These edge resources reside in geographically diverse, potentially capacity-constrained micro-sites managed via TMF674 (Geographic Site). Detail: 1) How would you model these dynamic edge compute capabilities within TMF620 (Product Catalog)? Should they be CFS or RFS specifications? How do you represent dynamic attributes like available capacity or latency characteristics? 2) How must TMF674 (Geographic Site) and associated SID Place ABEs be potentially extended or profiled to capture the real-time resource capacity and specific capabilities of each micro-site? 3) Describe the interaction between TMF679 (Product Offering Qualification - checking site capability/capacity), TMF622 (Product Order), TMF652 (Resource Order), and the extended TMF674/TMF639 (Resource Inventory) during the ordering and provisioning process. 4) What architectural pattern (e.g., polling, event subscription via TMF688) would you use to keep the edge site capacity information in TMF674/TMF639 reasonably up-to-date for qualification checks?"

    "question": "A Communications Service Provider (CSP) aims to transform its B2B operations by offering complex, bundled solutions (e.g., SD-WAN with integrated security services, cloud connectivity, and managed CPE) through a unified digital platform, leveraging ODA principles. Map this business objective to eTOM processes (Level 2/3 within areas like Marketing & Sales, Product Management, Customer Management, Service Management, Resource Management). Identify: 1) The critical ODA Functional Blocks and Core Commerce components required (e.g., Product Catalog, Customer Management, Order Management, Service/Resource Inventory, Assurance). 2) The key TM Forum Open API interactions needed to support the end-to-end quote-to-cash-to-assurance journey for such a complex B2B solution, highlighting how APIs like TMF620, TMF679, TMF622, TMF641, TMF652, TMF638, TMF639, TMF656, and TMF678 interact. 3) The main challenges in modeling these bundled solutions within the SID framework (Product, Service, Resource domains) ensuring clear decomposition from the commercial offering (Product) down to technical Service and Resource specifications. 4) How eTOM's process flows can guide the design of orchestration logic within ODA components like Service Order Management and Resource Order Management to handle the dependencies between different service components within the bundle?"
