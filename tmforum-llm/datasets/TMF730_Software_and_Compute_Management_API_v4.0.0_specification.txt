Introduction 
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Software and Compute entity management. 
It includes the model definition as well as all available operations. 
Overview 
The Resource domain covers Physical and Logical managed entities.  Increasingly physical network 
appliances are being replaced by virtualized counterparts realized as software hosted on general purpose 
computing infrastructure.  It is important that these software entities form part of a management continuum 
where physical and logical resources are equally well enabled. 
This API introduces the data schemas required to manage software and compute entities using the 
Resource Domain Open APIs. 
Concepts 
The basic building block concepts needed for managing software and compute entities are: 
• 
Software 
• 
Function 
• 
Connection Point 
• 
Process 
• 
Host 
Software is a computer program, a sequence of instructions in a programming language. A Function is a 
capability of a software which transforms input(s) into output(s). A Connection Point makes input and/or 
output for a Function available and may be realized by an application program interface (API).  A Process 
is an instance of execution of Software. A compute environment for software Processes is a Host. 
Software provides Functions which provide Connection Points. Any complex system may be decomposed 
into an interconnected structure of these basic elements. 
Data Model 
The above concepts are realized with the data model depicted in Figure 1 below. The 
Entity/EntitySpecification pattern, common to the TM Forum Open API data model, is applied for each 
entity type. 
An instance of InstalledSoftware represents one or more Processes which are either currently executing, 
or may potentially be executed in the future, and is described by a SoftwareSpecification.  
ResourceFunction instances are provided by InstalledSoftware and described by 
ResourceFunctionSpecification. The Connection Point(s) of a ResourceFunction are realized by API 
instances which are described by APISpecification.

Figure 1: Software and Compute Entity Relationships 
 
A SoftwareSpecification may reference an external SoftwareSupportPackage, which provides the files 
containing the programs required for instantiated Processes of the InstalledSoftware, and which may be 
described by a SoftwareSupportPackageSpecification.  A HostingPlatformRequirement provides the 
requirements on a Host which must be fulfilled to run the Software and is described by a 
HostingPlatformRequirementSpecification.

SAMPLE USE CASES 
5G Core Network Functions  
A 5G Core network slice subnet contains Functions such as the Access and Mobility Management 
Function (AMF).  
The following contrived example depicts one possible model for an AMF implemented as a Kubernetes 
cloud native function (CNF). Here the CNF is described in a Resource Catalog by specifications, as 
depicted in Figure 3, where a distributed AMF is implemented as a Kubernetes StatefulSet (represented 
as SoftwareSpecification) containing Pods (also represented as SoftwareSpecification). An AMF node 
(represented as ResourceFunction) implements interface connection points (represented as 
APISpecification) for internal RPC and external N2 (and normally many others).  
Figure 4 depicts the Function of an example distributed AMF instance, described in a Resource Inventory. 
The distributed AMF instance (represented as composite ResourceFunction) includes a connectionPoint 
attribute referencing the N2 interfaces (represented as API) while the connectivity attribute may contain a 
topology graph describing the internal nodes (represented as atomic ResourceFunction) connected 
through the RPC interfaces (represented as API).

ODA Components 
TM Forum’s own Open Digital Architecture (ODA) is composed of ODA Components which are 
implemented by Software and realized as Processes making Functions available over APIs. 
In Figure 5 a simplified example of a vendor (Acme) provided ODA Component instance is depicted. In 
this contrived example the instantiated ODA Component (represented as InstalledSoftware) provides a 
compound ResourceFunction (Acme Component) composed of vendor specific, and ODA specified, 
ResourceFunctions.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list 
of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit 
from base entities, for instance SoftwareSpecification and APISpecification inheriting properties from the 
abstract SoftwareResourceSpecification entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 
2 document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a 
list of ResourceSpecification instances some may be instances of SoftwareSpecification, 
ResourceFunctionSpecification, APISpecification, HostingRequirementSpecification and 
SoftwareSupportPackageSpecification. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-
resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an 
SoftwareSupportPackageRef object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice 
that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as and 
not the class type of the referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type 
is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of 
an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has 
been extended.

needs another already owned resource to rely on (e.g. an option on an already 
owned mobile access resource) [targets] or [isTargeted] (depending on the 
way of expressing the link) for any other kind of links that may be useful. 
resourceSpecification 
A resource specification reference (ResourceSpecificationRef). Resources are 
physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an 
enterprise's infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by 
services (for example a physical port assigned to a service) or contribute to the 
realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the 
Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, 
Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and 
technology components. 
A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic 
means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In essence, a 
ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set 
of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based 
on a particular ResourceSpecification.

resources to the one instantiate, such as [bundled] if the resource is a 
bundle and you want to describe the bundled resources inside this 
bundle; [reliesOn] if the resource needs another already owned resource 
to rely on (e.g. an option on an already owned mobile access resource) 
[targets] or [isTargeted] (depending on the way of expressing the link) for 
any other kind of links that may be useful. 
resourceSpecification 
A resource specification reference (ResourceSpecificationRef). 
Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some 
combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or inventory. 
They are typically consumed or used by services (for example a physical 
port assigned to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product 
(for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the Application, 
Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network 
Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and technology 
components. 
A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a 
generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In 
essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and

infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services (for example a physical port 
assigned to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be 
drawn from the Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network 
Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and technology components. 
A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a

A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic 
means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In essence, a 
ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set 
of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based 
on a particular ResourceSpecification.

owned mobile access resource) [targets] or [isTargeted] (depending on the 
way of expressing the link) for any other kind of links that may be useful. 
resourceSpecification 
A resource specification reference (ResourceSpecificationRef). Resources are 
physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an 
enterprise's infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by 
services (for example a physical port assigned to a service) or contribute to the 
realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the 
Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, 
Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and 
technology components. 
A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic 
means for implementing a particular type of Resource. In essence, a 
ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set 
of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based 
on a particular ResourceSpecification.

A resource status type (ResourceStatusType). Tracks the resource status of 
the resource, such as standby, alarm, available, reserved, suspended and so 
on.

state of the resource, such as idle, active, busy and so on. 
ResourceRelationship sub-resource 
Linked resources to the one instantiate, such as [bundled] if the resource is a bundle and you want to 
describe the bundled resources inside this bundle; [reliesOn] if the resource needs another already owned 
resource to rely on (e.g. an option on an already owned mobile access resource) [targets] or [isTargeted] 
(depending on the way of expressing the link) for any other kind of links that may be useful. 
@baseType 
A string. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class. 
@schemaLocation 
An uri (Uri). A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional attributes and 
relationships.

a bundle and you want to describe the bundled resources inside this bundle; 
[reliesOn] if the resource needs another already owned resource to rely on 
(e.g.: an option on an already owned mobile access resource) [targets] or 
[isTargeted] (depending on the way of expressing the link) for any other kind of 
links that may be useful. 
resource 
A resource ref or value (ResourceRefOrValue). Resource is an abstract entity 
that describes the common set of attributes shared by all concrete resources. 
The polymorphic attributes @type, @schemaLocation & @referredType are

validFor 
A time period. The period of time for which a characteristic is 
applicable. 
ResourceSpecificationCharacteristicRelationship sub-resource 
An aggregation, migration, substitution, dependency or exclusivity relationship between/among 
ResourceSpecificationCharacteristics. The specification characteristic is embedded within the 
specification whose ID and href are in this entity, and identified by its ID. 
@baseType 
A string. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class. 
@schemaLocation 
An uri (Uri). A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional 
attributes and relationships. 
@type 
A string. When sub-classing, this defines the sub-class Extensible name. 
characteristicSpecificationId A string. Unique identifier of the characteristic within the specification. 
name 
A string. Name of the target characteristic within the specification. 
relationshipType 
A string. Type of relationship such as aggregation, migration, substitution, 
dependency, exclusivity. 
resourceSpecificationHref 
An uri (Uri). Hyperlink reference to the resource specification containing 
the target characteristic.

characteristic 
A list of resource specification characteristics 
(ResourceSpecificationCharacteristic [*]). A characteristic that refines the 
relationship. For example, consider the relationship between a slot and a card. 
For a half-height card it is important to know the position at which the card is 
inserted, so a characteristic Position might be defined on the relationship to 
allow capturing of this in the inventory.

    - ResourceStateChangeEvent 
    - ResourceDeleteEvent 
Notifications related to ResourceSpecification: 
    - ResourceSpecificationCreateEvent 
    - ResourceSpecificationChangeEvent 
    - ResourceSpecificationDeleteEvent 
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event 
structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and 
the name of the resource (eventType). 
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to 
the resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" 
placeholder).

Patch resource 
  PATCH /resource/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a resource entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules 
concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to 
the PATCH operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non-patchable attributes, including constraint rules on 
their usage.

Patch resource specification 
  PATCH /resourceSpecification/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a resource specification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules 
concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to 
the PATCH operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample 
REST notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the 
REST Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its 
health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if 
it does not support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint 
can be created again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42
