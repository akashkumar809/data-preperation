 Introduction
The following document is intended to provide details of the REST API interface for Service
Inventory. The intent of this API is to provide a consistent/standardized mechanism to query
and manipulate the Service inventory.

Page 1


  
 
 
 Sample Use Cases
Service inventory query for a customer
The Service Inventory API can be used to query the service instances for a customer via
Self Service Portal or the Call Centre operator can query the service instances on behalf of
the customer while a customer may have a complaint or a query.
Note: Only the CustomerFacingServices instances will be presented to the customer.
Service inventory update as part of service provisioning
The Service Inventory API can be called by the Service Order Management to create a new
service instance/ update an existing service instance in the Service Inventory.
Service entity can be requested with:
• service features and/or service characteristics OR;
• an explicit intent based entity
The intent based request uses an expression language to express the expectations of the
intent.

 Support Of Polymorphism And Extension
Patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a TypeAService or
TypeBService inheriting properties from the base Service entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 document.
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Service instances some may be instances of TypeAService where
other could be instances of TypeBService. The @type gives this information. All resources
and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is
useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an RelatedParty
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
RelatedParty, and not the class type of the referred object. However since reference classes
are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

 Resource Model
Managed Entity and Task Resource Models
Service resource
Service is a base class for defining the Service hierarchy. All Services are characterized as
either being possibly visible and usable by a Customer or not. This gives rise to the two
subclasses of Service: CustomerFacingService and ResourceFacingService.

externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

The following table provides service state explanation:
A service is in state…
when the Service Component Activation Interface shall support the
following operations
feasabilityChecked
The service component OS is requested to determine whether the
necessary resources are available and sufficient for the installation
of a given service.
It should be noted that this is just an initial feasibility check and no
RFS is created.
designed
The Service Component OS is requested to design the service.
This could be use to allocate resource but nothing is supposed to
be reserved.
reserved
The Service Component OS is requested to reserve a resource, or
a set of resources, required for a service. This situation allows for
the requesting OS to determine whether the underlying resources
are available and reserve them in order to support a service (a
RFS).
As a result of the reservation request, a servce is instantiated &
reserved.
inactive
The service is deactivated - The Resource Facing service is
deactivated and thus is no longer available for service. It remains
allocated to the CFS that is managed by the high level service
activation OS
active
The service component OS is requested to activate a given
resource facing service such that the component is fully available
and active as part of the CFS.
When this request is complete, all RFS component shall be in
active state
suspended
When a service is suspended, its usage is restricted. Restrictions
can be added/removed for a feature or for the complete service.
terminated
The service is ‘logically deleted’. The resource facing service is
deleted and thus allocated from the CFS. All associated resources
are freed and made available for service to other users.
The following table provides service operating status explanation:
Service operating status
Definition
pending
The service provisioning has been initiated and/or the service is
undergoing configuration.
configured
The service is configured fully on the network and ready to become
operational.
starting
The service is transitioning and preparing to be in running status.
running
The service is fully up and in standard running status.

Service operating status
Definition
degraded
The service is degraded in some respect, such as in speed or
operating capacity. Failure of a test or an unacceptable
performance measurement has established that the service is not
fully operating or is degraded.
failed
The service has an internal fault that prevents it from operating.
limited
Particular aspect(s) of the service is restricted for use and hence
not fully operating.
stopping
The service is transitioning and preparing to be in stopped status.
stopped
The service is in stopped status and is not operational.
unknown
The operating status of the service not able to be determined.
Notification Resource Models
5 notifications are defined for this API.
Notifications related to Service:
• Service Attribute Value Change Event
• Service Delete Event
• Service Operating Status Change Event
• Service Create Event
• Service State Change Event
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the
figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub
class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId),
an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification
structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field
("resourceName" placeholder).

Updates partially a Service
PATCH /service/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a Service entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}
