 Introduction
This Service Problem Management API is used for the service providers (Defined as the
Middle B) to manage the service problems in their service area Service problem is generated
based on the information declared by Middle B or the event information notified from
infrastructure providers (Defined as the First B) who provide the infrastructure of cloud or
network. The event information includes alarm information, performance anomaly
information, trouble ticket information, SLA violation, maintenance information and prediction
information. Middle Bs can refer the service problems and the event information from First
Bs and when the service problems occur or its status have been changed, Middle Bs can
receive notifications. According to these functions, Middle Bs are able to grasp the service
problems quickly and accurately.

 Sample Use Cases
We assume following situation: There are Network Provider 1 (NP1) and 2 (NP2), which
provide network infrastructure, and Cloud Provider 1, 2, which provides cloud infrastructure,
as First Bs. Using these infrastructure, Service Provider 1 (SP1), 2 (SP2) and 3 (SP3) are
providing their services to their end-users as Middle Bs.
Use Case 1
When trouble happened in any resources of NW/Cloud Providers, Service Providers can
know their services are affected or not. The specific use case is following:
1. SPM collects configuration information of services provided by service providers in
advance using Product Inventory Management API, etc.
2. Each of Middle Bs – Service Provider 1 (SP1), Service Provider 2 (SP2), Service
Provider 3 (SP3) – registers the notification destination to SPM SPI.
3. When a fault occurs, SPM receives a trouble ticket from the Network Provider 1 (NP1).
4. SPM creates a Service Problem based on the Trouble Ticket.
5. SPM notifies the Service Problem creation notification to Middle B (SP1, SP3) to notify
expected service impact, based on the configuration information collected in advance.
6. When SPM receives a notification that the trouble ticket has changed to "In Progress"
state, update the status of the relevant Service Problem. Notify the Service Problem
state change notification to Middle B (SP1, SP3).

Use Case 2
To analyze the past problems, Middle B collects the problem information in the past one year
Use Case 3
Service providers can declare a new service problem based on trouble declarations from
their end-users. In addition, the SPM administrator can associate the service problem, based
on the Middle B declaration, with another problem based on a First B event such as a
Trouble Ticket. The specific use case is following:
1. Based on the report from the user that there is a problem in the Internet access, Middle B
(SP1) gets the current service problem.
2. After SPM collects the current Service Problems, returns that there are no problems
related to the service of the Middle B (SP1).
3. In order to request the analysis of this event, Middle B declares a new service problem.
4. Since the SPM administrator found that necessary detailed information was insufficient,
SPM administrator requests additional information about the behavior of the Middle B
side.
5. SP1 collects the specified additional information and registers it.
6. SPM administrator checks the additional information and accepts the Service Problem
(Problem 1).
7. First B(NP1) registers a detected problem event to the trouble ticket and notice a new
trouble ticket generation to SPM. The SPM creates a Service Problem (Problem 2)
based on the trouble ticket.
8. Since the two problems affects the same location, SPM administrator determines that the
declared problem (Problem 1) and the new problem based on the new trouble ticket
(Problem 2) is associated. SPM administrator associates Problem 1 with 2. In this case,
Problem 1 will have Problem2 as the association “underlyingProblem”. Note that Problem
1 can have an “parentProblem” as another association if he would like to group those

 problems.
9. Since the Problem 1 was changed to add a “underlyingProblem”, Service Problem
Change Notification is sent to SP1.
Use Case 4
The SPM administrator can associate and group multiple service problems so that service
providers can easily recognize what the real problem is. The specific use case is following:
1. SPM receives an alarm from NP1 and creates a Service Problem based on it (Problem
1).
2. SPM receives an SLA violation from NP2 and creates a Service Problem based on it
(Problem 2).
3. By analyzing problems, SPM administrator determines that Problem 1 and 2 are the
same problem. SPM administrator creates a new Service Problem (Problem 3) in order
to group and associate Problem 1, 2 and 3. In this case, Problem 3 is a parent and
Problem 1 and 2 are children.

 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

 RESOURCE MODEL
ServiceProblem status lifecycle
Following are the available status values for a service problem. The state graphic gives an
overview of the allowed status changes
• Acknowledged
• Rejected
• InProgress
• Held
• Pending
• Resolved
• Closed
• Cancelled

The following table provides the service problem status explanation:
Status
Definition
Acknowledged
The Service Problem is acknowledged by Service problem handler.
Rejected
The Service Problem was Rejected because of
• Invalid or inadequate information is provided
• Failes to meet the business rules with respect to the service
which consumer is raising a service problem against
• Is otherwise defective
InProgress
The service problem was validated by the service problem handler
and is being processed.
Held
Service problem handler is confirming further details internally
before completing a service problem.
Pending
Service problem handler is awaiting further confirmation on details
of a Fault from originator before it can progress the Fault.
Resolved
The fault indicated in the service problem was corrected by the
service problem handler and acknowledgement is awaited from its
originator.
Closed
The service Problem’s originator has acknowledged the ‘Resolved’
state of the service problem, or the timeframe for
acknowledgement has passed without response from service
problem originator.
Cancelled
The service problem was cancelled due to the following reasons:
• The service problem originator cancelled
• The service problem handler cancelled as the problem was not
related to the handler
• The service provider handler deemed that the problem cannot be
resolved (non-fixable problem)
Managed Entity and Task Resource Models

Field descriptions
ServiceProblem fields
affectedLocation
A RelatedPlaceRefOrValue. Entity reference. The polymorphic
attributes @type, @schemaLocation & @referredType are
related to the RelatedPlace entity and not the
RelatedPlaceRefOrValue class itself.
affectedNumberOfServices
An Integer. Number of affected services.
affectedResource
A ResourceRef. Resource reference, for when Resource is used
by other entities.
affectedService
A ServiceRef. Service reference, for when Service is used by
other entities.
category
A String. Classifier for the problem. Settable. For example, this is
used for distinguish the category of problem originator in
[role].[category] format. Example: serviceProvider.declarer,
supplier.originated, system.originated.
characteristic
A Characteristic. Describes a given characteristic of an object or
entity through a name/value pair. This is an abstract base class,
the actual value is in one of the strongly-typed subclasses :
StringCharacteristic, ObjectCharacteristic, FloatCharacteristic,
BooleanCharacteristic, NumberCharacteristic,
IntegerCharacteristic, StringArrayCharacteristic,
ObjectArrayCharacteristic, BooleanArrayCharacteristic,
NumberArrayCharacteristic, IntegerArrayCharacteristic…
creationDate
A DateTime. Time the problem was created.

description
A String. Free form text describing the Service Problem.
errorMessage
An ErrorMessage. Represents an Error.
externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.
firstAlert
A RelatedEntity. A reference to an entity, where the type of the
entity is not known in advance.
href
A String. Hyperlink reference.
id
A String. Unique identifier.
impactImportanceFactor
A String. Impact Importance is characterized by an Impact
Importance Factor: overall importance of the impact of all the
affected services, e.g. 0 (zero impact) to 100 (worst impact). The
Impact Importance is a calculated field which is set by the OSS
determining the impact.
impactPattern
An ImpactPattern. Define the patterns of impact (optional), such
as other service characteristics- Used when defining impact
through another pattern than the pre-defined attributes.
lastUpdate
A DateTime. Time the problem was last changed.
name
A String. Name of the Service Problem.
note
A Note. Extra information about a given entity.
originatingSystem
A String. Indicates where the problem was generated.
originatorParty
A RelatedPartyRefOrPartyRoleRef. RelatedParty reference. A
related party defines party or party role or its reference, linked to
a specific entity.
parentProblem
A ServiceProblemRef.
priority
An Integer. An indication varying from 1 (highest) to 10 (lowest)
of how important it is for the service provider to correct the
Service Problem.
problemEscalation
A String. Indicates if this service problem has been escalated or
not. Possible values are 0 to 10. A value of zero means no
escalation. The meanings of values 1-10 are to be determined by
the user of the interface, but they show increasing levels of
escalation.
reason
A String. Free text or optionally structured text. It can be
Unknown.
relatedEntity
A RelatedEntity. A reference to an entity, where the type of the
entity is not known in advance.

used to contact the party. This is an abstract base class, the
actual value is in one of the strongly-typed subclasses :

creationDate
A DateTime. Date and time when the GeographicSite was
created.
description
A String. Text describing additional information regarding the site.
externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

Notification Resource Models
17 notifications are defined for this API.
Notifications related to ServiceProblem:
• Create Event
• Delete Event
• Attribute Value Change Event
• Information Required Event
• State Change Event
Notifications related to ProblemAcknowledgement:
• Create Event
• Delete Event
• State Change Event
Notifications related to ProblemUnacknowledgement:
• Create Event
• Delete Event
• State Change Event
Notifications related to ProblemGroup:
• Create Event
• Delete Event
• State Change Event
Notifications related to ProblemUngroup:
• Create Event
• Delete Event
• State Change Event
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the
figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub
class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId),
an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification

Updates partially a ServiceProblem
PATCH /serviceProblem/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a ServiceProblem entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optional. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}

Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
