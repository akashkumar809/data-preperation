 Sample Use Cases
Private Optimized Binding Use Case for security company
What is the business context?
Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) platforms allow operators to expose telco capabilities to 3rd
party service providers in a programmatic manner, through Open Application Programming
Interfaces (APIs). These Open APIs pave the way for transforming telco networks into
programmable service platforms, enabling the integration of the network with 3rd party
applications, with frictionless interactions between them. This is a win-win situation for the
two stakeholders involved. For CSPs, this represents a business opportunity to generate
new revenue streams, and one of the ways to better monetize investment in 5G, access, and
edge computing. For 3rd parties, it allows them to flee from traditional over-the-top, best-
effort service delivery approaches, tapping now into offered capabilities to provide enhanced
user experiences and contribute to the digital ecosystem with new services.
What is the purpose?
The existing process for purchasing network services from Communications Service
Providers today is not aligned with customer expectations for a digital-first, on-demand
experience. CSPs need to decompose their network assets and make network services
available as API-enabled products. The network needs to be elastic to allows for bandwidth,
scaling and healing. For example, a CSP’s business customer who provides security guards
and services for special events at stadiums or public venues needs to have access to high-
quality video on demand. Developer of the cloud-based video security app can use NaaS
APIs to get performance data from the network and set a policy to configure an automatic
upgrade of service, or upgrade manually at the tap of a button.
Where is the value?
Creation of a new Tmforum NaaS API that will ensure that an application, deployed on the
Cloud by a 3rd party finds a path to the most performant broadband connection at the right
time. The fastest broadband connection is determined based on where the device/customer
is located and the most performant and available local network connection. By identifying
network APIs that customers really want, and standardizing them across the industry, it will
open up new lines of business for CSPs, Hyperscalers and App producers by improving the
experience of purchasing network services, drive innovation in the industry, and increase the
total addressable market for these services through the introduction of value-added
products.

 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

Updates partially a UserEquipment
PATCH /userEquipment/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a UserEquipment entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

Description
This operation allows partial updates of a CloudApplication entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

Description
This operation allows partial updates of a UserEquipmentSpecification entity. Support of

is 
mandatory, 
support 
of 
json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

This operation allows partial updates of a CloudApplicationSpecification entity. Support of

is 
mandatory, 
support 
of 
json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}

Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
