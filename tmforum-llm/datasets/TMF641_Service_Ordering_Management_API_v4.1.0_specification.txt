Introduction 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Service Order Management. It includes the model 
definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are creating, updating and retrieving Service Orders 
(including filtering). The specification covers also a task-based resource to request Service Order Cancellation. 
The following Assumptions were considered in the development of this document: 
- 
The Order Management system has access to a catalog system 
- 
A service order will describe a list of service order items. 
- 
A service order item references an action on an existing or future service. 
- 
By service we designed Customer-Facing Service (CFS) as well as Resource Facing Service (RFS). 
From a component perspective, a service order should be available 
• 
from a Service Orchestration Component (and it could mix CFS and RFS) 
• 
from an Infrastructure Control & Management component (and it would have only RFS) 
Service ordering API performs the following operations 
…on Service Order: 
• 
Retrieval of a service order or a collection of service orders depending on filter criteria 
• 
Partial update of a service order (including updating rules) 
• 
Creation of a service order (including default values and creation rules) 
• 
Deletion of service order (for administration purposes) 
• 
Notification of events on service order 
o service order creation 
o service order deletion 
o service order state change 
o service order value change used to notify that any data in an order has just changed 
o service order information required used to notify that some data in the order need to be filled / are 
missing 
…on CancelServiceOrder: 
• 
Retrieval of a service order cancellation request or a collection of service order cancellation requests 
depending on filter criteria 
• 
Creation of a service order cancel request  
• 
Notification of events on service order 
o cancel service Order creation 
o cancel service Order state change 
o order information required used to notify that some data in the cancel service order need to be 
filled / are missing

SAMPLE USE CASES 
 
We illustrate in this document a multi-items service order covering use-cases:  
• 
Item 1: Creation of a very simplified CPE illustrating an object characteristic 
• 
Item 2: Modification of an existing service to change a characteristic value and a supporting resource. 
• 
Item 3: Creation of a service with feature 
• 
Item 4 : Modification of a service order item to switch to inactive an existing service 
The document also provide an example to a cancel service order request/

Support of polymorphism and extension  
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base 
entities, for instance a TypeAServiceOrder or TypeBServiceOrder inheriting properties from the base ServiceOrder 
entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Design Guidelines v4.0 
(TMF630) document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
ServiceOrder instances some may be instances of TypeAServiceOrder where other could be instances of 
TypeBServiceOrder . The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type 
attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an RelatedParty object) to explicitly 
denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes 
the class type of the reference itself, such as RelatedParty, and not the class type of the referred object. However, 
since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

A Service Order is a type of order which can be used to describe a group of operations on service – one service order 
item per service. An action at the level of the service order item describe the operation to be done on a service (add, 
changer, terminate for example). The service order is triggered from the BSS system in charge of the product order 
management to the SOM (Service order Management) system that will manage the service fulfillment. 
Here is the state machine diagram for a Service order. Each order state is described in the following table. 
Note: Consistence rules are defined between order state & order item state.

ServiceOrder & ServiceOrderItem State definition:  
The following table provides service order state and service order item state description: 
State 
Definition 
Acknowledged 
The Acknowledged state is when an order/item has been received and 
has passed surface message validation. 
Rejected 
The Rejected state is where:  
• 
Invalid information is provided through the order request (not 
checked synchronously – like check that a service id provided

State

exist in the inventory and relation service order item action is 
valid) 
• 
The order request fails to meet business rules for ordering 
Same rules applied for order item. 
If an order item is rejected the complete service order is rejected. 
Pending 
The Pending state is used when an order/item is currently in a waiting 
stage for an action/activity to be completed before the order/item can 
progress further, pending order amend or cancel assessment. In 
situations where Access Seeker action is required, an “information 
required” notification will be issued on transition into this state.  
A pending stage can lead into auto cancellation of an order/item, if no 
action is taken. 
InProgress 
The in Progress state is where an order Item has passed the Order check 
successfully and service delivery has started. 
 
For the order at least one order item is inProgress 
Held 
The Held state is used when an order/item cannot be progressed due to 
an issue. Service provided has temporarily delayed completing an 
order/item to resolve an infrastructure shortfall to facilitate supply of 
order. Upon resolution of the issue, the order/item will continue to 
progress. 
AssessingCancellation 
Following a cancel request, the SP is assessing if cancel can be done for 
the order/item (or if the Service Order has reached PONR). If cancellation 
request is not accepted after assessment the order will return in Held or 
Pending or InProgress state. 
PendingCancellation 
Once a cancel order has been accepted by SP, it could in some UC take 
time to effectively cancel the order/item. During this time when accepted 
cancellation is effectively processed we use Pending Cancellation. 
Cancelled 
The Cancelled state is where an In-Flight Order/item has been successfully 
cancelled. 
Completed 
The Completed state is where an item has complete provision, and the 
service is now active. 
For an order if all order items are completed 
Failed 
Order item as not a successful delivery completion. The service is not 
delivered, and the order item failed. 
All Order items have failed which results in the entire Order has Failed. 
Partial 
Some Order items have failed, and some have succeeded so the entire 
Order is in a Partial state. This provides support for partial Failure of an 
Order (or a service order item with ‘embedded’ service order item) 
 
Lifecycle of Service 
Here is the state machine diagram for a Service:

The following table provided service state explanation: 
A service is in state… 
when the Service Component Activation Interface shall support the 
following operations 
feasabilityChecked 
The service component OS is requested to determine whether the 
necessary resources are available and sufficient for the installation of a 
given service. 
It should be noted that this is just an initial feasibility check and no RFS is 
created. 
designed 
The Service Component OS is requested to design the service. This could be 
used to allocate resources, but nothing is supposed to be reserved. 
reserved 
The Service Component OS is requested to reserve a resource, or a set of 
resources, required for a service. This situation allows for the requesting OS 
to determine whether the underlying resources are available and reserve 
them in order to support a service (an RFS). 
As a result of the reservation request, a service is instantiated & reserved. 
inactive 
The service is deactivated - The Resource Facing service is deactivated and 
thus is no longer available for service. It remains allocated to the CFS that is 
managed by the high level service activation OS 
active 
The service component OS is requested to activate a given resource facing 
service such that the component is fully available and active as part of the 
CFS. 
When this request is complete, all RFS component shall be in active state

terminated 
The service is ‘logically deleted’. The resource facing service is deleted and 
thus allocated from the CFS. All associated resources are freed and made 
available for service to other users. 
 
Note: when action ‘no change’ is used we did not expect any state change. 
CancelOrder State definition:  
State 
Definition 
Accepted 
The accepted state is where a CancelOrder request has been received and has passed 
message and basic business validations. Everything should be updatable in this state 
InProgress 
The InProgress state is when the CancelOrder is currently in the hands of server side to 
assess cancellation request. 
TerminatedWith
Error 
The CancelOrder could not be correctly completed by Service Order component. It did not 
mean that the cancel request is denied – it means that the assessment was not done 
Done 
CancelOrder assessment has been done. The Order has been cancelled or keep it as is if 
cancel request denied (for example, the order is in point Of No Return (PoNR).

Patch service order 
  PATCH /serviceOrder/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a service order entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST notification POST 
calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST Guidelines 
reproduced below. 
 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
