INTRODUCTION 
Services may be activated or configured by the Activation and Configuration API.  
The following examples use the characteristic specification and the strongly typed patterns.  
1) 
Using the characteristic specification pattern. When the characteristic specification pattern is used it is 
assumed that a service specification with the corresponding characteristic specifications exist. 
     "id" : "id1234567890", 
     "href" : "http//..", 
 
"state" : "active", 
 
"serviceSpecification":{ 
          "id":"conferenceBridgeEquipment", 
          "href":"http: //serverlocation:port/catalogManagement/serviceSpecification /conferenceBridgeEquipment" 
     }, 
     "characteristic":[ 
   { 
          "name":"numberOfVc500Units", 
           "valueType": "integer", 
          "value":"1" 
        }, 
        { 
          "name":"numberOfVc100Units", 
           "valueType": "integer", 
          "value":"2" 
        }, 
        { 
          "name":"routerType", 
           "valueType": "string", 
          "value":"CiscoASR1000" 
        }, 
        { 
          "name":"powerSupply", 
           "valueType": "string", 
          "value":"UK" 
        } 
     ]} 
 } 
2) Using the Strongly typed pattern. When the strongly typed pattern is used it is assumed that a corresponding 
YAML or JSON schema is defined for the Service. 
{          
   "id" : "id1234567890", 
   "href" : "http//..", 
   "state" : "active", 
   "@type" : "conferenceBridgeEquipment", 
   "@schemaLocation" : "http://../conferenceBridgeEquipment.json", 
 
 
"serviceSpecification":{ 
          "id":"conferenceBridgeEquipment", 
          "href":"http: //serverlocation:port/catalogManagement/serviceSpecification /conferenceBridgeEquipment" 
     }, 
     "numberOfVc500Units": "1",

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base 
entities, for instance a TypeAService or TypeBService inheriting properties from the base Service entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
Service instances some may be instances of TypeAService where other could be instances of TypeBService. The 
@type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be 
provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a RelatedParty object) to explicitly 
denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes 
the class type of the reference itself, such as RelatedParty, and not the class type of the referred object. However, 
since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

RESOURCE MODEL 
Managed Entity and Task Resource Models 
Service resource 
Service is a base class for defining the Service hierarchy. All Services are characterized as either being possibly 
visible and usable by a Customer or not. This gives rise to the two subclasses of Service: CustomerFacingService and 
ResourceFacingService. 
Resource model 
 
 
Lifecycle of Service 
Here is the state machine diagram for a Service.

The following table provided service state explanation: 
A service is in state… 
when the Service Component Activation Interface shall support the 
following operations 
feasabilityChecked 
The service component OS is requested to determine whether the 
necessary resources are available and sufficient for the installation of a 
given service. 
It should be noted that this is just an initial feasibility check and no RFS is 
created. 
designed 
The Service Component OS is requested to design the service. This could be 
use to allocate resource but nothing is supposed to be reserved. 
reserved 
The Service Component OS is requested to reserve a resource, or a set of 
resources, required for a service. This situation allows for the requesting OS 
to determine whether the underlying resources are available and reserve 
them in order to support a service (a RFS). 
As a result of the reservation request, a servce is instantiated & reserved. 
inactive 
The service is deactivated - The Resource Facing service is deactivated and 
thus is no longer available for service. It remains allocated to the CFS that is 
managed by the high level service activation OS 
active 
The service component OS is requested to activate a given resource facing 
service such that the component is fully available and active as part of the 
CFS. 
When this request is complete, all RFS component shall be in active state

thus allocated from the CFS. All associated resources are freed and made 
available for service to other users.

Patch service 
  PATCH /service/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a service entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines part 1. Refer to the guidelines for more details. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null}

Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be replaced by 
one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY 
refers to the data structure of the given notification type.
