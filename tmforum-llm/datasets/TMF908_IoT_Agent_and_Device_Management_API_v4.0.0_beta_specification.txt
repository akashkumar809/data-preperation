Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Any management. It includes the model definition 
as well as all available operations.

SAMPLE USE CASES 
Reader will find an example of use cases using Usage API in “Open Digital Business Scenarios and Use Cases” 
document.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, 
for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. 
The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be 
provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly denote 
the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class 
type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred 
object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

many different types of services; if bandwidth is a relevant characteristic (e.g., from the point-of-view of a 
Customer obtaining this Service via a Product) then bandwidth would be a ServiceSpecCharacteristic for that 
particular Service.

Resource Specification resource 
ResourceSpecification is a class that offers characteristics to describe a type of service. 
Functionally, it acts as a template by which Services may be instantiated. By sharing the same specification, these 
services would therefore share the same set of characteristics.

A date time (DateTime). Indicates the time (as a date + time) at which the alarm 
was reported by the owning OSS. It might be different from the 
alarmRaisedTime. For instance, if the alarm list is maintained by an EMS, the 
alarmRaisedtime would be the time the alarm 
  was detected by the NE, while the alarmReportingTime would be the time this 
alarm was stored in the alarm list of the EMS. 
alarmType 
A string. Categorize the alarm. Should be one of the values defined in X.733 8.1.1 
or 3GPP TS 32.111-2 Annex A: 
 
Communications Alarm 
 
Processing Error Alarm 
 
Environmental Alarm

Notifications related to Alarm:

    - AlarmChangeEvent 
    - AlarmDeleteEvent 
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure 
containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the 
resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the 
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder).

Patch iot device 
  PATCH /iotDevice/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of an iot device entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

Description 
This operation allows partial updates of an iot device specification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Patch alarm 
  PATCH /alarm/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of an alarm entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST notification POST 
calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST Guidelines 
reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if the request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null}

Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the callback 
url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be replaced by 
one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY 
refers to the data structure of the given notification type.
