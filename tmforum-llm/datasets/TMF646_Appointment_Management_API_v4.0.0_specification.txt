INTRODUCTION 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Any management. It includes the model definition as 
well as all available operations.

SAMPLE USE CASES 
The use cases are:  
 
• Create a new appointment,  
• Update an existing appointment because its status has changed (cancel an appointment for example) or 
party availabilities have changed (reschedule an appointment for example)  
• Retrieve a specific appointment or a collection of appointments  
 
Before creating or rescheduling an appointment, the available time slots could be checked according to 
criteria (like the reference of a specific technician for example…).  
To illustrate the JSON representation of resource concerned by this API, we use the two uses cases detailed 
below:  
 
Use case 1 (UC1): an appointment at a place  
 
 
Kate wishes that the appointment will be booked between the 13 and 16 of February.

Use case 2 (UC2): an appointment by phone

SUPPORT OF POLYMORPHISM AND 
EXTENSION PATTERNS 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list 
of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit 
from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the 
abstract Account entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 
2 document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list 
of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of 
SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a 
@type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to 
explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when 
used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, 
and not the class type of the referred object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, 
@type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an 
Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has 
been extended.

Patch search time slot 
  PATCH /searchTimeSlot/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a search time slot entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules 
concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to 
the PATCH operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non-Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on 
their usage.

Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its 
health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if 
it does not support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint 
can be created again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener.

POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null}
