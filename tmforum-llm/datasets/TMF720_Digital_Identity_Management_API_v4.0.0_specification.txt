Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Digital Identity management.  
A digital identity enables identification / authentication of Party, PartyRole, or Resource in order to allow 
Party, PartyRole, or Resource (for an app) to retrieve permission. Ideally, the digital identity should be 
defined at party level, but business UC could require having finer-grainer scope and require a digital identify 
for one or a set of party role. For example, it can be used to have a digital identity carrying all professional 
party role delegated by the employer and another one carrying all party role played personally. 
Digital Identity could be provided to an application to trigger interaction with other system (logistic system 
triggering automatically order to supplier)   
At least one Credential is needed for an active digital identity. A Credential enables identification / 
authentication.  In this API, credential specialization are provided but it could be extended by 
implementation. One or many contact medium might be defined for each Credential to be used for reset. 
Avatar(s) might be represented by an Attachment such as a picture. 
 
Following diagram illustrates the Digital Identity in a global party domain:

Sample Use Cases 
This section includes a set of main use cases that can be performed with this API. Additional use cases can 
be generated using the operations and resources defined in this specification. 
• create a digital identity for an individual in order to identify this customer to browse owned 
product inventory. The party could provide a cool jpg as avatar and pick phone medium for contact 
method to retrieve password (when lost) 
 
 
• Change avatar jpg for an existing digital identity 
• Manage a digital identity for an application and link authorization to this identity 
• Retrieve inactive digital identity to remove them

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list 
of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit 
from base entities, for instance a biometric credential and token credential inheriting properties from the 
credential entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 
2 document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list 
of credential instances some may be instances of biometric credential where other could be instances of 
login/password credential, network credential or token credential. The @type gives this information. All 
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance in RelatedParty object) to 
explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when 
used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as RelatedParty, and not the class type of the 
referred object (IndividualRef or OrganizationRef). However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, 
@type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an 
Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has 
been extended. 
 
Presence of sub classes in the TMF720 swagger 
The TMF720 swagger features: 
• 
EmailMedium and PhoneMedium as DigitalIdentityContactMedium specializations 
• 
BiometricCredential, TokenCredential, LoginPasswordCredential and NetworkCredential as 
Credential specializations

RESOURCE MODEL 
Managed Entity and Task Resource Models 
Digital Identity resource 
DigitalIdentity is a class that allow to describe a digital identity for an individual or a resource or a specific 
party role. One of these three MUST be provided. If an individual is provided, this identity will be for all 
her/his partyRole. To avoid confusion, it is recommended in this case to not provide partyRoleIdentified.

Notification Resource Models 
 
4 notifications are defined for this API 
Notifications related to DigitalIdentity: 
    - DigitalIdentityCreateEvent 
    - DigitalIdentityStateChangeEvent 
    - DigitalIdentityDeleteEvent 
    - DigitalIdentityAttributeValueChangeEvent 
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event 
structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and 
the name of the resource (eventType).

This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to 
the resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" 
placeholder).

Patch digital identity 
  PATCH /digitalIdentity/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a digital identity entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules 
concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to 
the PATCH operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on 
their usage.

API Notifications 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its 
health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if 
it does not support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint 
can be created again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null}

Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be 
replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) 
and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given notification type.
