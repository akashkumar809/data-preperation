 Introduction
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Party Interaction
management. It includes the model definition as well as all available operations.
Users are communicating constantly with our enterprises either calling, entering our stores
or using our websites and apps. Our companies are also communicating with them
proactively by sending them new offers and providing support through different channels.
Sometimes it is different to keep track of all those actions throughout all channels.
A Party Interaction captures information about past interactions in-order to re-use it in
future ones. This allows agents to serve users better by knowing the steps they went
through. It also allows customers to see better, the actions they have performed and how
they interacted with us.
The Party Interaction Management API provides a mechanism to manage party interactions.
Creation, update and retrieval.

 Sample Use Cases
Use Case Id
UC_TMF_PartyInteractionManagement_0001
Use Case Name
Agent checks previous user interactions
Summary
This case an agent, either from a store or call center, checks the previous
interactions a user had with the company.
Actor(s)
1. User (person, may or may not be a customer)
2. Agent (with a dashboard connected to the systems exposing the APIs)
Pre-Conditions
1. The identity of the user is known (his details were requested in the store or
his phone number identified when he called).
Begins When
When all pre-conditions have been met and the user begins speaking with an
agent. The agent requests using the dashboard the user’s interactions info.
Description
1. The agent requests the last user’s interactions.
2. His dashboard shows a timeline with all the user interactions of the user.
3. The agent clicks in one to see its details.
4. The detailed interaction appears on screen.
Use Case Id
UC_TMF_PartyInteractionManagement_0002
Use Case Name
User checks previous interactions in app
Summary
This case describes how an app might show the user a list of his last
interactions with the company.
Actor(s)
1. User (person)
2. Mobile App (system)
Pre-Conditions
1. App back-end is available.
2. User has logged into the mobile app.
Begins When
When all pre-conditions have been met the app may prompt a timeline with the
user’s last interactions as a consequence-of a user action within the app.
Description
1. The user logs in the app.
2. In-order to check when he visited a certain store, he clicks on the timeline
button.
3. The user sees when he last went there.
Use Case Id
UC_TMF_PartyInteractionManagement_0003
Use Case Name
Customer calls to call center and complain about his bill
Summary
This case an agent, either from a store or call center, start a new interaction
Actor(s)
1. User (person, a customer)
2. Agent (with a dashboard connected to the systems exposing the APIs)

Use Case Id
UC_TMF_PartyInteractionManagement_0003
Pre-Conditions
1. The identity of the user is known (his details were requested in the store or
his phone number identified when he called).
Begins When
When all pre-conditions have been met and the user begins speaking with an
agent. The agent requests using the dashboard the user’s interactions info.
Description
1. A customer calls the Customer Service for a bill dispute.
2. The Agent checks the customer bill and realizes that there is indeed a
problem with this customer. He performs the following actions : 
◦Previous bill adjustment
◦A goodwill (discount) will be given to the customer for loyalty and
retention reasons
3. As the customer seems to be happy with the solution, the Agent uses the
interaction to present a new offer to the customer (cf. cross-sell activity) 
4. The customer accepts this new offer
5. Agent sends additional commercial information about the new offer
 
This is described as below with one single partyInteraction which contains one
item (RelatedEntityRefOrValue) per InteractionItem : 
partyInteraction#1 (description : “call from Mr. Doe complaining about his bill”)
InteractionItem#1.1 : reason : creation of a troubleTicket (TT) to adjust the
previous bill. The items (RelatedEntityRefOrValue) is a link to this TT.
InteractionItem#1.2 : reason : creation of a productOrder (PO) to give the
discount to the customer. The items (RelatedEntityRefOrValue) is a link to this
PO.
InteractionItem#1.3 : reason : creation of a quote to represent the proposal
made 
to 
the 
customer 
in 
the 
cross-sell 
context. 
The items
(RelatedEntityRefOrValue) is a link to this quote (or no item is no quote is
done).
InteractionItem#1.4 : reason : creation of a productOrder (PO) to add the new
offer to the customer’s inventory. The items (RelatedEntityRefOrValue) is a link
to this PO.
InteractionItem#1.5 : reason : Commercial information and documentation is
sent to the customer. These documents are described here as attachments
(AttachmentRefOrValue).

 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections 
occurs 
when 
entities 
inherit 
from 
base 
entities, 
for 
instance 
a
StoreVisitPartyInteraction inheriting properties from the PartyInteraction. entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 document.
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of PartyInteraction instances some may be instances of
StoreVisitPartyInteraction. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-
resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an
PartyInteractionRef object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class.
Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the
reference itself, such as BStoreVisitPartyInteractionRef, and not the class type of the
referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally
not useful in reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub
class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId),
an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification
structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field
("resourceName" placeholder).

Updates partially a PartyInteraction
PATCH /partyInteraction/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a PartyInteraction entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.
