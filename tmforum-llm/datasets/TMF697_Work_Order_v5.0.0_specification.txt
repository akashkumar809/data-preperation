 Introduction
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Work Order Management. It
includes the model definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are
creating, updating and retrieving work orders as well as the task operation to cancel an in-
flight work order.
The Work Order API enables communication service providers (CSPs) to manage work
orders for their engineering workforce, streamlining network operations. It serves as a
standardized mechanism for managing work orders with all the necessary details required by
the engineering force to complete the tasks.
A work order is a document or electronic form that details a specific task or set of tasks to be
completed by a person or team within an organization. It serves as an official instruction or
directive for carrying out work, typically within a specific timeframe and according to
predefined specifications or requirements.
The demand for an engineer’s work to be completed is captured as part of the work order
and includes all the details of the engineer’s task. Work orders may also include information
about the following: * Details of the task(s) to be completed * Information about the
companies involved, including engineers * Job location * Skill, tool, and material
requirements * Any party part of the work order process (e.g., authorizing party) * Assigned
technician or service provider * Estimated and actual completion dates * Priority level *
Engineer whereabouts (travel details)
The primary purpose of a work order is to keep all parties within the maintenance operation
abreast of the workflow. When used effectively, work orders help an organization efficiently
organize, communicate, and track maintenance work within a department or organization.
The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with Workforce Management
systems in a consistent manner. Workforce Management applications manage field forces to
make optimum use of manpower and other resources such as vehicles. They are used to
schedule resources, provide a map of field skill sets and provide forecasting and load
balancing capabilities.
Workforce Management API can be used to manage both internal and external resources in
areas of service assurance,provisioning, routine work, and preventive maintenance.
• Workforce Schedule Management
• Work Order Analysis
• Work Order Assignment & Dispatch
• Work Order Tracking & Management
• Workforce Management Reporting
• Workforce Configuration and Setup
Work Order Management API performs the following operations on Work Order:
• Creation of a work order
• Partial update of a work order

Work Order Management API performs the following operations on CancelWorkOrder:
• Creation of a work order cancel request
• Retrieval of a work order cancellation request or a collection of work order cancellation
requests depending on filter criteria
• Notification of events on work order
◦Cancel Work Order creation
◦Cancel Work Order state change
◦Order information required used to notify that some data in the cancel work order
need to be filled / are missing

 Sample Use Cases
Creating a New Work Order
The service manager uses the API to create a new work order for a scheduled maintenance
task. They provide details such as the location, assigned technician, and priority level. Upon
submission, the API generates a unique identifier for the new work order and notifies
relevant parties.
Updating an Existing Work Order:
A field technician uses a mobile application integrated with the Work Order API to update the
status of an existing work order. They may add notes, update completion status, or modify
task details as necessary. The API records the changes and notifies the service manager of
any updates.
Retrieving Work Orders for Inspection
The quality assurance team utilizes the API to retrieve a list of work orders that have been
completed recently. They review the details of each work order, including tasks performed,
completion dates, and any reported issues. This helps ensure that maintenance tasks are
carried out to the required standards.
Cancelling a Work Order
In case of unforeseen circumstances or changes in priorities, the operations manager
initiates a request to cancel a scheduled work order using the API. They provide a valid
reason for cancellation and specify any associated costs or implications. The API processes
the cancellation request and updates the status of the work order accordingly.
Analyzing Work Order Trends
The business analyst accesses historical data from the Work Order API to analyze trends in
work order completion rates, resource utilization, and maintenance costs. They use this
information to identify areas for improvement, optimize scheduling, and make data-driven
decisions to enhance operational efficiency.
Managing Workforce Assignments
The resource manager uses the Work Order API to assign available technicians to pending
work orders based on their skills, availability, and geographic location. They leverage the
API’s scheduling and dispatching capabilities to ensure optimal allocation of resources and
timely completion of tasks.
These use cases demonstrate the some of the capabilities of the Work Order API in
facilitating various aspects of work order management, from creation and updating to
analysis and workforce coordination.

 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingTroubleTicket
and NetworkTroubleTicket inheriting properties from the abstract TroubleTicketcount entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of TroubleTicket instances some may be instances of
BillingTroubleTicket where other could be instances of NetworkTroubleTicket. The @type
gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes
that can be provided when this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an TroubleTicket
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingTroubleTicketRef or NetworkTroubleTickeRef, and not the class type of the referred
object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not
useful in reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optional. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}

Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
