 Introduction
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Alarm management. It
includes the model definition as well as all available operations.
Alarm Information
An alarm is described in increasing detail by the attributes shown in the diagram below.
Every alarm must include an alarmType which places the fault within a small set of broad
categories. A probableCause is also required and attributes one of an industry agreed set
of descriptions of the probable cause. Vendor specific descriptions may be contained in
specificProblem and more detailed information about the fault may be provided in
alarmDetails.
Alarm Type
The categories for alarm classification are defined in X.733 8.1.1 and 3GPP TS 32.111-2
Annex A. The complete enumerated list of possible values for the mandatory alarmType
attribute is as follows:
Alarm

alarmType
Description
communicationsAlarm
A communications fault.
processingErrorAlarm
A software or processing fault.
environmentalAlarm
A condition related to an enclosure in which the
equipment resides.
qualityOfServiceAlarm
A degradation in the quality of a service.
equipmentAlarm
An equipment fault.
integrityViolation
Information may have been illegally modified,
inserted or deleted.
operationalViolation
The unavailability, malfunction or incorrect
invocation of a service.
physicalViolation
A physical resource has been violated in a way
that suggests a security attack.
securityService
A security attack has been detected by a security
service.
mechanismViolation
A security attack has been detected by a security
mechanism.
timeDomainViolation
An event has occurred at an unexpected or
prohibited time.
Probable Cause
Probable Cause values are defined in ITU-T X.733 and 3GPP TS 32.111-2 Annex B. It is
highly recommended to choose a value from the existing list. If none of the values from
standarts are satisfactory consider choosing "other" and describe your situation with the
specificProblem attribute.

 Sample Use Cases
The Alarm Management API provides the standardized client interface to Alarm
Management systems for creating, tracking and managing alarms among partners. The
interface supports alarm management on both resources and services. The alarmed objects
are not restricted to any particular technology or a vendor, so the API can be used in a wide
variety of fault management cases.
In real-life deployments we see various levels of fault management API needs starting from
simple 
subscription 
on 
alarm 
lifecycle 
events, 
up 
to 
full 
synchronization 
of
acknowledgements and root cause analysis between two alarm management systems.
Two main kinds of business scenarios were identified:
• Management Functions subscriptions ("simple" alarm notifications)
• Synchronization of Management systems (on alarm events, threshold crossing alarms,
acknowledgements, root cause analysis, etc.)
Sample Use Case – Simple Alarm Forwarding
In the first case, one party of the interface is an Alarm Management system (the alarm-
owning system) and the second party is a management function that is subscribed on
events, mainly alarm life-cycle events. It cannot be assumed that the subscribed function
has a persistent view of the alarms, as it is not necessarily an alarm management system.
The subscriber party can be a UI, a communication hub, a Service Quality management
system, a BSS system, or any other function that is interested in alarm events. In this case,
the operations that will be used are typically:
• Alarm life-cycle notifications:
◦Raise notification (mandatory)
◦Clear notification(mandatory)
◦Change notification (optional)
• Get Alarms operations: used by the Management Function to get synchronized on the
state of active alarms in situations where snapshots of the active alarms are required,
such as system start, or recovery from communication failures. This operation may
include a filter on the subset of alarms that are of interest.
• The acknowledgement notification (optional)

Sample Use Case – OSS-to-OSS
The second case is where the two parties are both alarm management systems/functions
and they have to synchronize alarms in different aspects. Typically, Alarm Management
system A is one of the alarm data sources of Alarm management system Z. In this case the
operations will be slightly different with a tighter integration:
• Alarm management system A can raise, change and clear alarms in Alarm Management
system Z
• Alarm management system A can acknowledge alarms in Alarm Management system Z
• Alarm Management system A can apply root cause analysis results in Alarm
Management system Z by using the Group and Ungroup operations.
• Alarm management system A can comment (annotate) alarms in Alarm Management
system Z
• Get Alarms operations used by the Management Function to get synchronized on the
state of active alarms in situations where snapshots of the active alarms are required,
such as system start, or recovery from communication failures. This operation may
include a filter on the subset of alarms that are of interest.

In this scenario, since the level of integration is tighter, it is important that Alarm
Management System A gets the information on the success of the operations in Alarm
management system Z.

 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

Field descriptions
Alarm fields
ackState
A String. Provides the Acknowledgement State of the alarm
(unacknowledged, acknowledged). ENUMERATED with values:
* unacknowledged
* acknowledged
ackSystemId
A String. Provides the name of the system that last changed the
ackState of an alarm, i.e. acknowledged or unacknowledged the
alarm.
ackUserId
A String. Provides the id of the user who has last changed the
ack state of the alarm, i.e. acknowledged or unacknowledged the
alarm.
affectedService
A ServiceRef. Service reference, for when Service is used by
other entities.
alarmChangedTime
A DateTime. Indicates the last date and time when the alarm is
changed on the alarm-owning system. Any change to the alarm
whether coming from the alarmed resource, or triggered by a
change from the client is changing this time.

A DateTime. Indicates the time (as a date + time) at which the
alarm is cleared at the source.
alarmDetails
A String. Contains further information on the alarm.
alarmEscalation
A Boolean. Indicates if this alarm has been escalated or not.
alarmRaisedTime
A DateTime. Indicates the time (as a date + time) at which the
alarm occurred at its source.
alarmReportingTime
A DateTime. Indicates the time (as a date + time) at which the
alarm was reported by the owning OSS. It might be different from
the alarmRaisedTime. For instance, if the alarm list is maintained
by an EMS, the alarmRaisedtime would be the time the alarm
was detected by the NE, while the alarmReportingTime would be
the time this alarm was stored in the alarm list of the EMS.
alarmType
An AlarmType. Categorizes the alarm (X.733 8.1.1, 3GPP TS
32.111-2 Annex A). ENUMERATED with values:
* communicationsAlarm
* processingErrorAlarm
* environmentalAlarm
* qualityOfServiceAlarm
* equipmentAlarm
* integrityViolation
* operationalViolation
* physicalViolation
* securityService
* mechanismViolation
* timeDomainViolation

identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId),
an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification
structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field
("resourceName" placeholder).

Updates partially a Alarm
PATCH /alarm/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of an Alarm entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optional. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}

Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
