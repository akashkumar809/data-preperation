Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Geographic Site management. A geographic site is a 
specialization of the abstract Place entity (like Geographic Address and Geographic Location).  
 
This specification includes the Geographic site model definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions 
are creating, updating and retrieving geographic sites.  
  This API covers the operations to manage (create, read, delete) sites that can be associated to a customer, an 
account, a service delivery or other entities. 
This API defines a Site as a convenience class that allows to easily refer to places important to other entities, where 
a geographic place is the entity that can answer the question “where?”, allowing to determine where things are in 
relation to the earth's surface, and can be represented either in a textual structured way (geographic address) or as 
a geometry referred to a spatial reference system (geographic location) 
This API relates with the following two APIs also covering SID GeographicPlace entity 
• 
Geographic Address Management API, specific to manage places defined in a structured textual 
way (street name, street number …) and validate existence of given address definition. 
• 
GeoLocation API specific for management of places defined as a geometry in the spatial reference 
regarding the surface of the Earth (coordinates …) and the relationship between different geolocations 
(distance, proximity …)

This API allows the following operations  
- 
Create a new site 
- 
Partial update of a geographic site  
- 
Retrieve a list of sites stored in a server filtered by a given criteria 
- 
Retrieve a specific site 
- 
Notification of events on a geographic site 
o geographic site creation 
o geographic site removal 
o geographic site status change 
o geographic site value change used to notify that any data in a geographic site has just changed

Sample Use Cases 
This section includes a set of main use cases that can be performed with this API. Additional use cases can be 
generated using the operations and resources defined in this specification. 
• Create a site in the server and associate a given customer/account to that site. The site definition includes 
all the address definition (street name, street number…) as well as the type of site it is in the relationship 
with the customer and the validity period for the relationship  
• Request a new product order and associate the delivery of any of the products/services in the order to 
one of the sites that have been associated to a customer/account 
• A customer creates a new trouble ticket for technical assistance requiring an agent to provide assistance 
in a specific geographic address, identified as one of the sites allocated to the customer

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base 
entities, for instance a Warehouse and Customer Access inheriting properties from the Geographic Site entity itself 
inheriting from geographic place. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
Geographic Site (or Geographic place) instances some may be instances of Warehouse where other could be 
instances of physical store. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a 
@type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance in PlaceRef object) to explicitly denote 
the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the 
class type of the reference itself, such as WarehouseRef or PhysicalStoreRef, and not the class type of the referred 
object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

Notification Resource Models 
 
4 notifications are defined for this API 
Notifications related to GeographicSite: 
    - GeographicSiteCreateEvent 
    - GeographicSiteAttributeValueChangeEvent 
    - GeographicSiteStatusChangeEvent 
    - GeographicSiteDeleteEvent 
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure 
containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the 
resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the 
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder).

Patch geographic site 
  PATCH /geographicSite/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a geographic site entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

API Notifications 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST notification POST 
calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST Guidelines 
reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
