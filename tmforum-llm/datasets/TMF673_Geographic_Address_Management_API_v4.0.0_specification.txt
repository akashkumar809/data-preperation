Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Geographic Address management. A geographic 
address is a specialization of the abstract Place entity (like Geographic Site and Geographic Location).  
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for geographic address management. It includes the 
model definition as well as all available operations. 
The Geographic Address Management API provides a standardized client interface to an Address management 
system. 
It allows looking for worldwide addresses. 
It can also be used to validate geographic address data, to be sure that it corresponds to a real geographic address. 
Finally, it can be used to look for a geographic address by: searching an area as a start (city, town …), then zooming 
on the streets of this area, and finally listing all the street segments (numbers) in a street.

SAMPLE USE CASES 
This section includes a set of main use cases that can be performed with this API. Additional use cases can be 
generated using the operations and resources defined in this specification. 
• Validate an address input by customer as part of order capture process  
• Get the location (GeographicalLocation) of a given address  
• Get geographic objects (Area, Street, StreetSegment) associated to an address

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, 
for instance a Warehouse and Customer Access inheriting properties from the Geographic Site entity itself inheriting 
from geographic place. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
Geographic Site (or Geographic place) instances some may be instances of Warehouse where other could be 
instances of Customer Access. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a 
@type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance in PlaceRef object) to explicitly denote 
the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class 
type of the reference itself, such as WarehouseRef or CustomerAccessRef, and not the class type of the referred 
object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended. 
 
Some APIs, like Product Ordering, support providing a GeographicAddress as a polymorphic version of Place, per 
reference or per value. However, in the case there is a need to provide a specific GeographicSubAddress this 
cannot be done solely per reference, because the href mechanism doesn’t allow this. In that case the 
GeographicAddress itself can be provided per reference, but the GeographicSubAddress (at least its id) has to be 
provided per value: 
… 
“place”: 
{ 
    "id": "7513180", 
    “geographicSubAddress”: 
     { 
          “id”: “3” 
     }, 
   “@type”: “GeographicAddress” 
}

Patch geographic address validation 
  PATCH /geographicAddressValidation/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a geographic address validation entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null}

Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be replaced by 
one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY 
refers to the data structure of the given notification type.
