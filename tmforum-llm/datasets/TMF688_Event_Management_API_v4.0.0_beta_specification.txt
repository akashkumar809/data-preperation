Introduction 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Event management. It includes the model definition 
as well as all available operations.  
 
TMF APIs already support the capability of publishing Events to subscribers using pub/hub pattern over REST (using 
a Hub Resource see Design Guideline Part 1, section 12). 
The current pub/hub subscribe pattern uses call-back based mechanism to deliver events to subscribers. 
 
The Event API supports the large scale distributed publish and subscription for events generated by many TMF 
Open APIs. 
 
This support for large scale publishing of multiple event types enable different scenarios enabling Event based 
architectures. 
 
The Open Event Model provides a rich definition of Events, their payloads, their metadata using the concept of 
schema defined events-building on our polymorphic design pattern. 
 
The Event API can be implemented using scalable event frameworks like Kafka or Rabbit MQ.

SAMPLE USE CASES 
Event queries (Use Case 1) 
 
The Event API can be used to query the resource instances to acquire event states and the attributes. For example, 
acquiring a list of AlarmNotificationEvents by filtering the eventType. 
 
Event create (Use Case 2) 
 
The Event API can be used to create to store the event instances. For example, create a production topic first and 
post an alarm Event into that topic/event resource.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base 
entities, for Instance the “Alarm Event” or the “Order Create Event are all instances of Events derived from the 
Common Event type. 
This means the common event data model can be extended by any kind of event payload because of the 
polymorphic data structure definition. 
By that polymorphic pattern the common event data model describes the event taxonomy of any event type. 
 
 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
Event instances some may be instances of Alarm Events where other could be instances of OrderCreation Events. 
The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be 
provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AlarmRef object) to explicitly denote 
the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the

class type of the reference itself, such as AlarmRef or OrderCreateRef, and not the class type of the referred object. 
However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

Hub resource 
A Hub is used to subscribe to an event notification related to a particular Topic.

The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure 
containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the 
resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the 
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder).

Event Management by Topics 
Topic/Event Resource Graph 
Event Management supports the Event streaming concept by the Topic resource. The Topic resource is the 
target container for the event resource. The topic/event resource can be used for storing different events into 
different topics separated into domains. (e.g., Party, Resource, Product,..) A topic/event resource graph can be 
set-up for further processing and analytic functions. 
The different topics can also be used for different access control on the topic/event resource because of the 
different endpoints of the Event API by topics. 
Example: Creation of a “Resource” topic for Alarm events: 
REQUEST 
POST //eventhub/eventapi/topic 
{ 
  "contentQuery": "Alarm.priority=normal", 
  "headerQuery":  “eventType=AlarmCreateNotification” 
  "name": "Resource" 
  "@baseType": "topic", 
  "@schemaLocation": "http://schemaregistry/Topic.schema.json", 
  "@type": "topic" 
} 
 
 
RESPONSE 
201 Created 
Content-Type: application/json 
 
{ 
                     "id": "13", 
                     "href": "http://eventhub/eventapi/topic/13", 
     "contentQuery": " Alarm.priority=normal ", 
      "headerQuery": "eventType=AlarmCreateNotification",

      "name": "Resource", 
      "@baseType": "topic", 
      "@schemaLocation": "http://schemaregistry/Topic.schema.json", 
      "@type": "topic" 
} 
 
 
 
The example below shows how different event streams (e.g., Party/Customer & Resource/Alarm) might be 
used to create new event stream (e.g., experience Analytics by Job2) and to create a further event stream 
(Party/TroubleTicket by Job 3) holding information for customer trouble tickets into the Party/TroubleTicket 
event resource. 
An event streaming transformation graph is shown below by topic/event resources.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null}

POST /client/listener 
Accept: application/json

    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE" 
}
