Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Sales Management. It includes the model definition 
as well as all available operations. 
 
This API provides interfaces for Sales Lead, Sales Opportunity, Sales Quote and the other management capabilities 
to support the sales activities to build relationship with the prospect customer who could be a person or organization 
that has an interest in the goods and/or services and possibly become the actual customers with one or more 
subscriptions. 
 
The first release of this API specifies only the SalesLead resource. 
 
The Lead corresponds to the nominal result of an interaction involving a prospective customer towards one of offers 
or services. It is the first stage (S) of the SPANCO process. 
 
A prospect could have expressed a commercial interest or a commercial interest has been detected from his behavior 
analysis. The Lead Management function enables to collect, evaluate and attribute the leads to the appropriate sales 
representatives. The lead is an interest concerning an offer family or a product line, or expressed literally during an 
interaction, possibly further to a marketing campaign, and it must be handled and specified to become an 
opportunity or an order. 
 
In a nominal way, once the interest towards offers or services is confirmed and the prospective customer clearly 
identified, then an Opportunity is created.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, 
for instance a CustomerInterest and B2BInterest, inherit properties from the abstract SalesLead entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
SalesLead instances some may be instances of CustomerInterest where other could be instances of B2BInterest. The 
@type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be 
provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a SalesLeadRef object) to explicitly denote 
the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class 
type of the reference itself, such as CustomerInterestRef or B2BInterestRef, and not the class type of the referred 
object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42

Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be replaced by
