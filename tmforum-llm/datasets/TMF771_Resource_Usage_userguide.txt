 Introduction
This document is the user-guide of the REST API for Resource Usage Management. It
includes the data model definition as well as all available operations for the Usage and
UsageSpecification resources.
The Resource Usage Management API provides a standardized mechanism for resource
usage management such as the creation, update, retrieval, import and export of a collection
of usages. A resource usage is an occurrence of employing a Resource, Resource Usage
can influence of Service Usage and/or Product Usage.
The Resource Usage API manages measurement usages. For example, it allows a service
provider to count usage of Antenna for 5G slice:
• To retrieve usage
• Collect Usage and update usage of Service and Product
The Resource Usage API manages the Resource Usage resource:
• A Resource Usage represents an event of usage. It is comprised of characteristics which
define all the attributes known for that particular type of usage.
• The main attributes are its id, usageDate, usageType, it’s usageType related
UsageSpecification, characteristics (name/value pairs), status, related Parties
• A Resource Usage follows a simple lifecycle which is presented later for illustrative
purposes, defining such aspects as whether it is rated, rerated or billed.
The Resource Usage API performs the following operations on the Usage resource:
• Retrieval of a Resource Usage or a collection of Resource Usage, depending on filter
criteria
• Partial update of a Resource Usage or of a collection of Resource Usage
• Creation of a Resource usage

 Sample Use Cases
A few simple use-cases are presented:
• Creation of a simple ResourceUsageSpecification, defining the characteristics a data
usage in Antenna for 5G slice; listing ResourceUsageSpecification’s at version 2.5;
retrieving a single ResourceUsageSpecification based on it’s id and ultimately its deletion
based on the same id.
• Creation of a simple ResourceUsage relating to a voice call retrieval; listing Resource
Usage of usageType “DATA”; retrieving a specific Resource Usage based on it’s id;
updating a Resource Usage and ultimately deleting this Usage based on the same id.

 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

ResourceUsage is usage event for Resource.
description
A String. Description of resource usage.
externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

resourceSpecification
A ResourceSpecificationRef. Resources are physical or non-
physical components (or some combination of these) within an
enterprise’s infrastructure or inventory. They are typically
consumed or used by services (for example a physical port
assigned to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product
(for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the
Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for
example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and
information, and technology components. A
ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing
a generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource.
In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common
attributes and relationships of a set of related Resources, while
Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a particular
ResourceSpecification.

charSpecRelationship
A CharacteristicSpecificationRelationship. An aggregation,
migration, substitution, dependency or exclusivity relationship
between/among Characteristic specifications. The specification
characteristic is embedded within the specification whose ID and
href are in this entity, and identified by its ID.
characteristicValueSpecification
A CharacteristicValueSpecification. Specification of a value
(number or text or an object) that can be assigned to a
Characteristic. This is an abstract base class, the actual value is
in one of the strongly-typed subclasses :
BooleanArrayCharacteristicValueSpecification,
BooleanCharacteristicValueSpecification,
FloatArrayCharacteristicValueSpecification,
FloatCharacteristicValueSpecification,
IntegerArrayCharacteristicValueSpecification,
IntegerCharacteristicValueSpecification,
MapArrayCharacteristicValueSpecification,

id
A String. Unique ID for the characteristic.
isUnique
A Boolean. Specifies if the value of this characteristic is unique
across all entities instantiated from the specification that uses
this characteristic. For example, consider a ProductSpecification
for a set-top box, with a CharacteristicSpecification cardID. Each
set-top box must have a different value for cardID, so this
isUnique attribute would be set to true for the characteristic.
maxCardinality

CharacteristicValue can take on. For example, zero to five phone
numbers in a group calling plan, where zero is the value for the
minCardinality.
name
A String. A word, term, or phrase by which this characteristic
specification is known and distinguished from other characteristic
specifications.
regex

 • Attribute Value Change Event
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the
figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub
class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId),
an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification
structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field
("resourceName" placeholder).

Updates partially a ResourceUsage
PATCH /resourceUsage/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a ResourceUsage entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optional. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

Updates partially a ResourceUsageSpecification
PATCH /resourceUsageSpecification/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a ResourceUsageSpecification entity. Support of
json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) 
is 
mandatory, 
support 
of 
json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optional. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}

Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
