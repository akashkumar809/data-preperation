Introduction 
 
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for the AI Management Suite. It includes the model 
definition as well as all available operations.  
 
The following figure illustrates the different elements of the API Management Suite:

SAMPLE USE CASES 
Following is an example use case for an Image Segmentation and Classification model. 
 
 
The elements present in the PCP Model Specification are related to the training data sets, software libraries,  
Gpu and the PCP and Connector types in use.

     The elements enforced by the PCP Model Contract are the image input quality, the distribution of PCP 
     types in input data, the distribution of PCP and Connector types in the output. 
 
 
 
The elements present in the AI Model specification contains information about the model development history, the 
Inherited model, the model contract version history and the Model evaluation data.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, 
for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of Account 
instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type 
gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when 
this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly denote 
the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class 
type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred 
object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or to 
specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been extended.

Ai Model Specification resource 
AiModelSpecification is a class that offers characteristics to describe a type of service. 
Functionally, it acts as a template by which Services may be instantiated. By sharing the same  specification, these 
services would therefore share the same set of characteristics.

ResourceSpecificationRef relationship 
Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an enterprise's 
infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services (for example a physical port assigned 
to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the 
Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, 
content and information, and technology components. 
A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a particular 
type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set of 
related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a particular ResourceSpecification.

threshold rule is crossed or ceased to be crossed. 
conformancePeriod 
A time period. A period of time, either as a deadline 
(endDateTime only) a startDateTime only, or both. 
conformanceTargetLower 
An integer. A value used to determine if the Performance 
threshold is crossed or ceased to be crossed, serving as a lower 
value.

The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure 
containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the 
resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the 
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder).

Patch ai contract specification 
  PATCH /aiContractSpecification/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of an ai contract specification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

Patch ai model 
  PATCH /aiModel/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of an ai model entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

Patch ai model specification 
  PATCH /aiModelSpecification/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of an ai model specification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Description 
This operation allows partial updates of an ai contract entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null}

Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be replaced by 
one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY 
refers to the data structure of the given notification type.
