INTRODUCTION 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Service Test Management. It includes the model 
definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are creating, updating and retrieving Service Test.  
The Service Test API provides a standardized mechanism for placing a service test with all the necessary test 
parameters. The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with CRM/Service Management systems in 
a consistent manner. A service test is a procedure intended to check the quality, performance, or reliability of a 
service.  
Service Test Management API manages service test resource and service specification test resource: 
- 
A service test specification describes the service test in terms of parameters to be configured and measures to 
be taken. 
- 
A service exists for a controlled test invocation on a service. The service test is executed according to a 
schedule. and contains service test configuration parameters that are to be applied at execution time, and 
service test measures that result.

SAMPLE USE CASES 
Service Test for Customer Experience Assurance 
The Service Test can be used for customer experience assurance while: 
⚫ 
The subscriber can launch service test from Self Service Portal to make sure the service quality while his/her 
experience is not good. 
⚫ 
The Call Center operator can execute service test to check the quality and analyze root cause for response 
while one customer has complaint  
 
It could improve customer experience and increase FCR (First Call Resolution). 
Planned Service Test for Important Services  
The test job can be defined for some important services where the tests can be executed periodically to assure the 
service quality and find potential service downgrade in advance to avoid impact to customers.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below.  
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. All resources and sub-resources 
of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. Such as ServiceTest, 
ServiceTestSpecification Entity. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be 
provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance ServiceRef) to explicitly denote the 
actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class 
types of the reference itself, such as ServiceRef, and not the class type of the referred object. However, since 
reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended. 
Notice that because these meta-attributes have a generic meaning, we will not repeat their definition in the 
resource description tables of each resource and each sub-resource.

Notification Resource Models 
 
7 notifications are defined for this API 
Notifications related to ServiceTest: 
    - ServiceTestCreateEvent 
    - ServiceTestAttributeValueChangeEvent 
    - ServiceTestStateChangeEvent 
    - ServiceTestDeleteEvent 
Notifications related to ServiceTestSpecification: 
    - ServiceTestSpecificationCreateEvent 
    - ServiceTestSpecificationAttributeValueChangeEvent 
    - ServiceTestSpecificationDeleteEvent 
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure 
containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the 
resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the 
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder).

This operation allows partial updates of a service test entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

Patch service test specification 
  PATCH /serviceTestSpecification/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a service test specification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.

Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener.
