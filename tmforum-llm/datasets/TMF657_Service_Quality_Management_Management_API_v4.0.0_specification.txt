Introduction 
The following document is the Service Quality Management REST API Specification.  
 
As the Digital Economy emerges, the Digital Service Providers, Consumers and Developers are striving to 
take advantage of Open Digital Eco-system to create, manage and support new Digital Services. 
In this context, the ability to deliver consistent digital services experience across the Eco-system 
between different enterprises is considered table-stakes. This focus on digital service delivery and 
quality has positioned Service Quality Management at the center of Digital Operations.  
 
Gathering data from multiple and heterogeneous data sources across the eco-system, combining them 
into meaningful service quality metrics is the core activity of a Service Quality Management application 
to assess the quality as perceived by the consumer.  
 
Once the measurements are available, they must be watched against contracted service level to ensure 
consistent delivery as committed to in Service Level Agreements (SLA). The Service Quality Management 
API defines a standard interface designed to simplify the integration task of an SQM application with 
different partners and respective Digital Operations Centers. This API follows the RESTful design 
principles. 
 
Through this API, any Enterprise is able to access a Service Quality Management application and extract 
Service Level Specifications and associated Service Level Objectives (SLO) and their thresholds. They can 
monitor violation of these thresholds and generate trending reports over a period of time and send 
threshold crossing alarms so that when service quality degrades and a contracted Service Level 
Agreement (or one of its constituents) is at risk, appropriate actions can be performed.

Sample Use Cases  
Use Case Id 
UC_TMF_ServiceQualityManagement_0001 
Use Case Name 
Service Quality Monitoring 
Summary 
The SQM API enables Clients within external or internal systems to 
access the Service Quality Management Application and monitor 
the quality of specified services against their SLOs 
Actor(s) 
Clients’ resident external and internal to the Enterprise as 
described in figure 3 are acting as the Consumer. SQM Application 
is the actor acting as the Producer. 
Pre-Conditions 
a) SLAs between Enterprise and Service Provider have been 
agreed and defined, which represents contractual agreement 
between parties for quality of specific services 
b) OLAs (Operations Level Agreements) between Customer Care 
Operations and Service Management Center of the Service 
Provider should be agreed and defined, which represents 
agreement between Departments for quality of specific 
services 
c) SLOs representing actual thresholds to be monitored have 
been defined 
d) SLOs have been mapped to Key Quality Indicators for the 
services monitored by the Service Quality Management 
application 
Begins When 
When all pre-conditions have been met and agreed period of 
monitoring between the Client and Service Quality Management 
Application starts 
Description 
This functionality enables the Client of Service Quality 
Management Application to Create/Query/Delete Service Level 
Agreements, its items, Service Level Specifications and Service 
Level Objectives 
AND 
Register for notifications when defined Service Level Objectives 
are at breach and the contracted SLA or OLA is at risk.  
These notifications trigger appropriate actions for resolution. 
Ends When 
In case of termination of contract or agreement and there is no 
need for monitoring or the agreed period for monitoring has come

to an end 
Post-Conditions 
In case of no breach of Service Level Objectives: 
1. The Client continues to monitor in an ongoing basis 
2. Occasionally the client may update and modify the SLAs/SLOs 
or introduce new services. 
 
In case of breach of Service Level Objectives: 
1. Notifications are sent to the Client system to ensure 
preventive measures can be taken and ensure there is no 
impact to Business and if there is any loss then it can be 
minimized. 
2. Notifications are sent to the Service Provider systems so Root 
Cause Analysis can be performed, and corrective action 
triggered for resolution. 
Exceptions 
1. In case of regular maintenance or system upgrades there may 
be planned outages that are part of agreed breach of SLOs and 
generated notifications should be ignored. There should be 
exception raised with the Client and suggest the notification is 
misleading ‘Ignore Notifications for this period, due to Routine 
Maintenance’ 
3. In case the mandatory details are invalid then an ‘Invalid input’ 
exception shall be raised along with the details of validation 
failure and thus the operation is not fulfilled 
4. In case the authentication of the Requesting Client is not 
validated by the Service Quality Management application then 
an ‘Access Denied’ exception shall be raised, and the 
operation is not fulfilled 
5. If the SQM Application is unable to accomplish the operation, 
due to a lack of internal resources then an ‘Unable To Execute’ 
exception shall be raised, and the operation is not fulfilled.  
6. 
If the SQM Application is unable to accomplish the operation, due to any 
other internal error, then an ‘Internal Error’ exception shall be raised, and 
the operation is not fulfilled.

between parties for quality of specific services 
b) OLAs (Operations Level Agreements) between Customer Care 
Operations and Service Management Center of the Service 
Provider should be agreed and defined, which represents 
agreement between Departments for quality of specific 
services 
c) SLOs representing actual thresholds to be monitored have 
been defined 
d) SLOs have been mapped to Key Quality Indicators for the 
services monitored by the Service Quality Management 
application 
e) Data must have been collected and stored for Service Quality 
and easily accessible to generate the reports 
Begins When 
When all pre-conditions have been met and the Client desires to 
build different types of reports for a specific period 
Description 
SQM API allows a client of the API to trigger the generation of 
Service Quality Reports, containing information to track how the 
various Service Level Agreement Items as well as the Service Level 
Objectives have been delivered over time and there are any 
observable trends. 
The reports can be scheduled defining the sample period and the 
reporting period, as well as other attributes such as the format of 
the report, how it should be delivered, etc.  
Ends When 
In case of success: 
The Client has received the Reports for the specified period 
In case of failure: 
The Client has not received the Reports for the specified period  
Post-Conditions 
 
Exceptions 
1. In case of regular maintenance or system upgrades there may 
be planned outages that are part of agreed breach of SLOs and 
generated reports for that period should be ignored. There 
should be exception raised with the Client and suggest the 
data is misleading ‘Ignore Reports during this period, due to 
Routine Maintenance’ 
2. In case the mandatory details are invalid then an ‘Invalid input’ 
exception shall be raised along with the details of validation 
failure and thus the operation is not fulfilled 
3. In case the authentication of the Requesting Client is not 
validated by the Service Quality Management application then 
an ‘Access Denied’ exception shall be raised, and the 
operation is not fulfilled

Support of polymorphism and extension 
patterns 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list 
of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities 
inherit from base entities, for instance a VPNServiceLevelSpecification inheriting properties from the 
ServiceLevelSpecification entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Design Guidelines. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. All resources and 
sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities to explicitly denote the actual entity type of 
the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the 
reference itself, and not the class type of the referred object. However, since reference classes are 
rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of 
an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has 
been extended.

The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event 
structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), 
and the name of the resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked 
to the resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" 
placeholder).

Patch service level objective 
  PATCH /serviceLevelObjective/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a service level objective entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch 
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules 
concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies 
to the PATCH operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules 
on their usage.

Patch service level specification 
  PATCH /serviceLevelSpecification/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a service level specification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch 
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules 
concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies 
to the PATCH operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules 
on their usage.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample 
REST notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the 
REST Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its 
health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service 
if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an 
endpoint can be created again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"}
