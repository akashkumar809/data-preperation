Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for ProcessFlow Management. It includes the 
model definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are creating, updating, and retrieving 
ProcessFlow, ProcessFlowSpecification, TaskFlow and TaskFlowSpecification.  
 
ProcessFlow definition vs execution: 
 
ProcessFlowSpecification & 
TaskFlowSpecification 
ProcessFlow & TaskFlow 
Design-time 
Run-time 
A business process is modeled (via BPMN or 
other): a ProcessFlowSpecification (made of 
TaskFlowSpecification) describes the business 
process.  
 
The ProcessFlow orchestration defines for 
ProcessFlowSpecification & 
TaskFlowSpecification: 
• 
interaction(s) with business 
entitySpecification 
• 
characteristicSpecification(s) 
• 
list of channel(s) where process could be 
run 
• 
associated party role(s) specification 
potentially involved 
A processFlow is created when we require to 
execute a ProcessFlowSpecification instance. 
Process/Task 
• 
Triggered business entities creation & 
update 
• 
Valued characteristic 
• 
Listed the channel where the 
interaction(s) occurred 
• 
Associated party role identifier involved 
in the Process/task 
• 
… 
Our proposal: add a capability to define 
processFlow via a processFlow specification 
(same taskFlow specification) 
 
 
The TMF701 ProcessFlow API allows management of business process definition and execution: 
 
• A ProcessFlowSpecification will define an orchestration of TaskFlowSpecification. A TaskFlow 
Specification could be re-use by several ProcessFlowSpecification 
• A ProcessFlow will describe an orchestration of TaskFlow. A TaskFlow is unique to one given 
ProcessFlow and cannot exist independently from it. 
• TaskFlow could be completed automatically (rules, event triggered, process delegation) or 
requiring manual action 
 
ProcessFlow API manages ProcessFlow, ProcessFlowSpecification, TaskFlow and TaskFlowSpecification 
resources: 
• 
A ProcessFlowSpecification is a business process specification described in in BPMN engine or hard 
coded. It describes relationship with other entity specification but also party involved in this 
specification design. 
• 
A ProcessFlow represents an instance of a pre-designed ProcessFlowSpecification. It defines a start 
point, a sequence of TaskFlow (that could be dynamically instantiated) and end point(s). Entities 
involved in the process completion could be related to the ProcessFlow) 
• 
A TaskFlowSpecification is a business process task specification – in other words, a “work” 
description to be done within a ProcessFlowSpecification

• 
A taskFlow is an instantiation of a TaskFlowSpecification. It could an automated work (send an 
email, execute a business rule, wait for an event triggered by an external system) or an human work (a 
form to be completed).  
 
TMF701 ProcessFlow API performs the following operations on ProcessFlowSpecification resource: 
• 
Retrieval of a ProcessFlowSpecification or a collection of ProcessFlowSpecification(s) depending on 
filter criteria 
• 
Creation of a ProcessFlowSpecification 
• 
Updation a ProcessFlowSpecification 
• 
Deletion of ProcessFlowSpecification  
• 
Notification of events on ProcessFlowSpecification 
o 
ProcessFlowSpecification creation 
o 
ProcessFlowSpecification status change 
o 
ProcessFlowSpecification deletion 
o 
ProcessFlowSpecification attribute value change 
…on TaskFlowSpecification resource: 
•

• 
Notification of events on ProcessFlow 
o 
ProcessFlow creation 
o 
ProcessFlow status change 
o 
ProcessFlow deletion 
o 
ProcessFlow attribute value change 
And on TaskFlow resource: 
• 
Retrieval of a TaskFlow or a collection of TaskFlow (s) depending on filter criteria 
• 
Creation of ProcessFlow 
• 
Partial update of a TaskFlow  
• 
Notification of events on TaskFlow 
o 
TaskFlow creation 
o 
TaskFlow status change 
o 
TaskFlow deletion 
o 
TaskFlow information required 
o 
TaskFlow attribute value change 
 
 
The following assumptions were considered in the development of this document: 
• 
The processFlow API should relie on a bpmn tool but nothing prevent to have it from an hard-coded 
component.

Note on future changes: 
 
To accommodate backward compatibility for this 4.1 version we keep existing ProcessFlowSpecification and 
TaskFlowSpecification ‘simple’ attributes in respectively ProcessFlow and TaskFlow resources. We introduce 
ProcessFlowSpecificationRef and TaskFlowSpecificationRef ‘complex’ attributes to allow relationship to newly 
introduce ProcessFlowSpecification and TaskFlowSpecification resource. 
 
Moving forward in v5 we will only keep ProcessFlowSpecification and TaskFlowSpecification attributes but defined 
them with complex attributes.

SAMPLE USE CASES 
To illustrate JSON we’ll use the following example of a definition of a ProcessFlowSpecification featuring 5 
TaskFlowSpecification (tfs99, tfs0, tfs1, tfs2 and tfs3). For the processFlow & taskFlow examples we use instances of 
theses. 
 
We’ll use an orderCapture process that will manage a ‘shoppingCart’ initialization and completion. The process is 
very simple: 
• 
The orderCapture process is launches with contextual information about the party interaction but also 
customer identification if present. 
• 
A productOffering may be passed in this request. If not the first task is to ask for one. 
• 
A product id from the inventory could be pass for modification change (not described). 
• 
Once commercial eligibility done, a shoppingCart is initialized. 
• 
After shopping cart configuration and user acknowledgement, a task is performed to check cart 
completion and if it’s succesful a orderCompletion processFlow is launched. 
These examples are only for illustration purpose and they must not be considered as process guideline.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, 
for instance an OrderCaptureProcess and a BillDisputeProcess inheriting properties from ProcessFlow entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
ProcessFlow instances some may be instances of OrderCaptureProcess where other could be instances of 
BillDisputeProcess. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type 
attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a ProcessFlowRef object) to explicitly 
denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes 
the class type of the reference itself, such as OrderCaptureProcessRef or BillDisputeProcessRef, and not the class 
type of the referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in 
reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event 
structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and 
the name of the resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to 
the resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" 
placeholder).

Patch process flow specification 
  PATCH /processFlowSpecification/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a process flow specification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules 
concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to 
the PATCH operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on 
their usage.

Patch task flow specification 
  PATCH /taskFlowSpecification/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a task flow specification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules 
concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to 
the PATCH operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on 
their usage.

Patch task flow 
  PATCH processFlow/{processFlowId}/taskFlow/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a task flow entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules 
concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to 
the PATCH operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on 
their usage.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST notification POST 
calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST Guidelines 
reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health state, 
execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support 
multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"}
