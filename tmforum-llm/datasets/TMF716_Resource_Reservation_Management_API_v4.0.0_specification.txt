Introduction 
 
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Any management. It includes the model definition as 
well as all available operations.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base 
entities, for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account 
entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. 
The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be 
provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly 
denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes 
the class type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of 
the referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in 
reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

8 notifications are defined for this API 
Notifications related to ResourceReservation: 
    - ResourceReservationCreateEvent 
    - ResourceReservationAttributeValueChangeEvent 
    - ResourceReservationDeleteEvent 
    - ResourceReservationStateChangeEvent 
    - ResourceReservationInformationRequiredEvent 
Notifications related to CancelResourceReservation: 
    - CancelResourceReservationCreateEvent 
    - CancelResourceReservationStateChangeEvent 
    - CancelResourceReservationInformationRequiredEvent 
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure 
containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the

Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42
