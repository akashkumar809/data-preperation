 General Information 
This document contains the text of the Business Process Framework for context and more information please refer to âGB991 Core Frameworks Concepts
and Principlesâ guidebook. 
 Preface 
eTOM Business Process Framework 
The eTOM or Business Process Framework is a reference framework for categorizing all the business activities used by an enterprise involved in delivering
on-line Information, Communications and Entertainment services. This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process 
components or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to
show organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. 
The eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and
the starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional 
application for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an 
industry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with 
other enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required 
functions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. 
 
 Introduction 
This document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out 
this domain. 
The focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke
Product, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes. 


The decomposition starts with a top level process which is a Core Process that details the activity that takes place and describes all subsequent activities 
that occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then
describing a unique path of action and further detail the specific process. This is then repeated to lower level of granularly of up to seven levees.  
At the start of each Level 2 process a diagram details all of its sub processes is placed. This diagram showers Level 3 process and the level 4 process 
below them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition
include another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   
Process Associations and IDs 
To aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. 
Processes have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: 
.b.x.c.d.e where  
 
b: 
This digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses 
to  
extended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   
x: 
Digit representing Domain  
c: 
Digit representing Level 2 process 
d: 
Digit representing Level 4 process 
e: 
Digit representing Level 5 process 
The unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. 


Typographic Conventions 
 
Â·  A Business Process is represented by a decorator in form of an arrow located to the top right. A red dot decorator with the initial TMF indicates that 
this is a TM Forum Business Process. The color yellow background hints to the business  layer.

Extended Description: 
Service Strategy Management processes enable the development of a strategic view and a multi-year business plan for the enterpriseâs services and 
service directions, and the parties who will supply the required services. Research & analysis is performed to determine service targets as well as strategie
to reach the defined targets. This research may be obtained from the external market, or developed internally through research programs and activities, or 
leverage of other internal knowledge. A key input to the service strategy arises from the enterpriseâs market and product portfolio strategy and forecasts. A 
focus is placed on the expansion of the existing service capabilities and the identification of new service capabilities required. 
These processes deliver and develop annual and multi-year service plans in support of products and offers that include volume forecasts, negotiation for 
required levels of resources, gaining service development and management as well as supply chain commitment and executive approval for the plans. 
Forecasting of service demand, and capturing of new opportunities, are both essential to ensure that the enterprise can implement the services necessary 
for the future needs of their customers and potential customers. 
These processes define the service standards sought, key new service capabilities required, service support levels and approaches required, service 
design elements to be developed, as well as service cost parameters and targets. These processes also define the policies relating to technical services 
and their implementation. 
This process was renamed in 24.0 Old Name was Service Strategy & Planning
