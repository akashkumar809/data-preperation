on-line Information, Communications and Entertainment services. This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process 
components or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to
show organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. 
The eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and
the starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional 
application for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an 
industry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with 
other enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required 
functions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. 
 
 Introduction 
This document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out 
this domain. 
The focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke
Product, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes.

that occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then
describing a unique path of action and further detail the specific process. This is then repeated to lower level of granularly of up to seven levees.  
At the start of each Level 2 process a diagram details all of its sub processes is placed. This diagram showers Level 3 process and the level 4 process 
below them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition
include another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   
Process Associations and IDs 
To aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. 
Processes have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: 
.b.x.c.d.e where  
 
b: 
This digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses 
to  
extended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   
x: 
Digit representing Domain  
c: 
Digit representing Level 2 process 
d: 
Digit representing Level 4 process 
e: 
Digit representing Level 5 process 
The unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. 


Typographic Conventions

procedures for ensuring continuation of business processes and activities in the event of serious and/or sustained interruption. These processes ensure 
that appropriate plans and procedures are established and tested to provide continuous operation, or controlled re-establishment, of key business 
processes and activities, to provide for a controlled recovery of infrastructure capability to normal levels, and for determination of operational accountability
and processes until the abnormal circumstances are resolved. These processes have four major aspects: 
• Business continuity planning which provides for the proactive planning and testing of business and operational procedure continuity; 
• Infrastructure recovery planning which provides for the pro-active determination of recovery and backup procedures for all key infrastructure capabilities, 
and their proactive testing; 
• Serious incident management planning which defines the operational roles and responsibilities, and proactively defines the operational procedures and 
escalation criteria which are initiated when abnormal operation circumstances occur 
• Business continuity management methodologies, which ensure consistent application of business continuity management across the enterprise. 
Note that business continuity management is an extended process structure which incorporates disaster recovery planning. 
Note that serious incident management is used instead of crisis management as serious disruption can occur to the business through events which would 
not normally be classified as a crisis.

associated operational capabilities that integrates assurance and specific risk  disciplines, into a data-centric, pro-active assurance umbrella framework wit
the goal to continuously protect and improve financial integrity, enhance business value and customer experience.   
Business Assurance  is a second level of defence (quality monitoring) across all value chains in the organization which have financial or customer impact 
and it can be interpreted as set of measures overtaken by an organization to assure that the processes and data flow are running as designed and to 
prevent any financial or reputational damage by not fulfilling the business, regulatory, legal, compliance and customer expectations. Furthermore, advance
Business Assurance processes focus on new opportunities to boost overall business performance. Business Assurance process helps ensure that the 
company delivers working services, compliant and efficient processes, and secure information throughout customer and product life cycles. Business 
Assurance process in transformation and change () provides the company with intelligence on change/ risk impact, end-to-end process transparency, risk 
ownership and establishes assurance methodologies and controls. Business Assurance also integrates risk  techniques across diverse business models, 
ecosystems and value chains. Business Assurance  is cross-functional and typically composed of active risk  processes such as Revenue and Cost 
Assurance , Fraud Management , Margin Assurance , Asset Assurance , Migration Assurance , Digital Transformation Assurance , Ecosystem Assurance 
Regulatory Assurance  and Customer Experience Assurance .

 Manage Revenue Assurance Framework 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.1 
Hierarchy Level: 3 
Brief Description: 
Establish an enterprise-wide revenue and cost assurance policy framework, and an associated operational capability aimed at minimizing revenue  and 
cost leakage within the enterprise, without influencing demand. 
Extended Description: 
The objective of the Manage Revenue Assurance Framework   processes is to establish an enterprise-wide revenue and cost assurance policy framework,
and an associated operational capability to resolve any detected revenue and cost assurance degradations and violations. Revenue and Cost Assurance  
processes identify areas of revenue and cost leakage risk within the enterprise, and monitor industry trends and best practice approaches to ensure that th
enterprise remains at the forefront of revenue leakage minimization and cost efficiency maximization. These processes support the categorization and 
prioritization of areas of revenue leakage and excessive costs risk. To achieve this, these processes define the policies, guidelines, practices and 
procedures to be followed and provide assistance to the enterprise operational areas to deploy appropriate procedures and monitoring capabilities. 
Revenue and Cost Assurance  processes deal with the establishment of tools and data collection capabilities to capture details of operation activity, 
analysis of monitored activity to detect and correct actual revenue leakage or excessive costs. These processes work in conjunction with operational and 
other process elements to guide them in supporting the specific needs of Revenue and Cost Assurance . Where appropriate, Revenue and Cost Assurance
processes supplement the capabilities of these other process elements, to control and analyze the enterprise behavior relevant to Revenue and Cost 
Assurance needs. 
The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to: 
•Establishing and managing a revenue assurance policy framework, including identification of controls and measures 
•Implementing identified controls and measures, setting up the Data collection capabilities and tools needed to support operational processes 
•Establishing and managing an operational process capability able to detect and resolve revenue and cost assurance degradations and violations 
•Establishing and managing a capacity to regularly review the revenue assurance policy framework to ensure it meets the enterprise’s changing objectives


The objectives of Revenue Assurance, mainly towards the end-customer, are to be enriched with the scope of Cost Assurance: 
•to ensure that all the utilization/ consumption/ subscription to third parties’ services/resources are fully and correctly captured, and timely processed 
•to ensure that all the payments and settlements to third parties are calculated correctly according to contracts and agreements and according to the real 
utilization of the third parties’ resources

Extended Description: 
The objective of this process is to  Define Revenue and Cost Assurance Policies and Controls process and to establish and manage a framework of 
policies and measurable controls that are used to manage the risk associated with revenue and cost assurance, and to optimize the enterprise’s appetite 
for revenue and cost assurance risk.  
These processes are responsible for, but not limited to:  
•Establishing and managing a revenue and cost assurance policy framework which is aligned with the overall enterprise goals and objectives 
•Developing a framework of controls and KPIs which achieves the defined revenue and cost assurance goals and objectives

The Define Revenue and Cost Assurance Policies and Controls  has a specific responsibility in developing and defining controls and Key Performance 
Indicators (KPIs) used for RA,  
in conjunction with operational and other processes elsewhere in the enterprise.  
Where processes elsewhere in the enterprise have an intrinsic capability to instrument their own performance and behavior (as an aspect of operating 
effectively within the business),  
the Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Framework process makes use of this capability, but can also provide guidance to these processes in the form 
of modified, or additional, KPIs,  
required to support the overall role of Revenue and Cost Assurance . This can involve individual process elements throughout the enterprise (as 
appropriate for the various aspects of Revenue and Cost Assurance  that apply), or may involve co-ordination across a number of process elements where
Revenue and Cost Assurance  acts to provide an integrated or coordinated view of the overall situation.  
With regard to KPI definition, the Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Framework process establishes the objectives used to identify the minimum level 
of satisfactory performance required for a given control point or a process from an RA perspective, and works with other process element in the enterprise 
to effect this.  
With regard to development of Revenue and Cost Assurance controls, the Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Framework process applies policy-based
rules that represent the logical definition of comparisons performed on entities, such as bills and call detail records.  
These are used together with Revenue and Cost Assurance KPIs, to identify discrepancies from an RA perspective.

of digitization evolutions in the RA environment. 
 
Extended Description: 
While the Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Policy Frameworks Process ensures what activities and measures shall be applied and how and the 
Manage Revenue and Cost Assurance Operations Process tracks their outcome, the objective of the  Implement Revenue Policies Processes are the 
detailed implementation steps of the defined KPIs, according to their respective and before-hand evaluated priority, in the manner stated by the RA policy 
framework, within the technical RA solution tool, considering the evolution of the environment which's probable leak shall sought to be covered.  
 
The process objective is to perform a conception of how to implement a control to meet the requested objectives used to identify the minimum level of 
satisfactory performance required for a given control point or a process from an RA perspective. 
It's aim is to analyze the business process of a given control point, set up and perform an ETL process and develop a Revenue and Cost Assurance Artifac
and configure its alarming, most preferably by delivering automated results.  
 
The responsibilities of the processes include, but are not limited to: 
•Conception of Business Assurance artifacts like KPIs, controls and metrics

  Manage a Fraud Management Framework 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2 
Hierarchy Level: 3 
Brief Description: 
Establish an enterprise-wide fraud  policy framework, and an associated operational capability aimed at identifying and preventing internal and external 
fraud in an organization. 
Extended Description: 
Manage a Fraud Management Framework process ensure real-time screening of transaction activity across users, accounts, processes and channels, to 
identify and prevent internal and external fraud in an organization.  The objective of the Fraud  in general is to detect fraud risks, activities, and other 
violations, as well as to detect and prevent the re-surfacing of known fraudulent activities, individuals, and syndicates.   
Fraud  is chartered within an operator to conduct 2 primary functions within the operator’s business model:  Create and maintain a fraud policy (enabling 
methods, activities, and other procedures to detect,  prevent, and manage discovered fraud instances within the operator), and support of fraud operations
(creation and  of rules, lists, tools/solutions used for detections, staff education, etc.).   
The objective of the Fraud  in general is to detect fraud risks, activities, and other violations, as well as to detect and prevent the re-surfacing of known 
fraudulent activities, individuals, and syndicates.  Proactive detection processes are preferable to reactive mitigation and  of existing fraud, hence the 
importance of policy and support functions to provide tools to operational components in the enterprise to prevent fraud before it becomes harmful to the 
business. Inevitably, reactive processes must also be supported, as fraud tactics are in a continual state of change, posing a constant threat to operators.

 Manage Tool Policies 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2.1.1 
Hierarchy Level: 5 
Brief Description: 
Establish and manage all policies related to the employment, use, and maintenance of tools and/or solution platforms used in fraud detection, investigation
and management. 
Extended Description: 
The objective of Tool Policy Management is to provide oversight to the entire lifecycle of a fraud tool or solution within the organization.  This includes 
several key components: 
 
1. Identification of the need for a tool or solution.  This will include the creation of business case materials needed to support the need for investment in 
technology to replace manual operations or enhance volumes of data being analyzed, etc.  This process will also be the origination point for requirements 
vetting, collecting, and aggregation into RFx issuance, and the subsequent review and scoring of responses received. 
2. Deployment scope and project management of any tool or solution.  While the operator often contains an internal PMO for deployment 
activities/oversight, actual requirements needed by the Fraud program must be represented and ensured by the policy process.  
3. Staff preparation.  Use of technology requires training in both the use of the technology and the fraud domain itself to understand rules and processes 
being employed by tools.  The policy process must identify and maintain the necessary staff requirements to operate tools to the full extent of their deploye
capabilities. 
4. Ongoing process and rule enhancement.  Tools are subject to modifications and enhancements necessary to address constant changes within the fraud
environment.  The policy process must maintain guidelines on when rules and processes may be enhanced or updated. 
5. Access to fraud tools and systems.  Tools within the fraud environment have access to particularly sensitive information that require increased levels of 
security.  Policies must be in place to determine who is allowed access to these tools, and specifically, what actions they are allowed to perform within 
these fraud tools.  For example, configuration of rules for detection should be performed by appropriate staff to ensure fair yet thorough application of any

Hierarchy Level: 5 
Brief Description: 
This process serves as a repository of  M&P (Methods and Procedures) information that maintains best practices for fraud analysis and identification work.
Extended Description: 
Within the fraud practice, certain processes are formulated to provide consistency and control around analysis of suspected fraud and the supporting 
investigative work to determine whether a given case is, in fact, fraud.  Analysis and identification procedure policies may include M&P information 
covering: 
 
- When an issue is eligible for investigation (e.g., meeting certain alarming criteria, having a high enough financial value, etc.).  
- How issues are prioritized once deemed eligible for investigation (ranking in work queue, assignment to rapid teams vs. longer term investigation teams, 
etc.)

 Manage Fraud Classification 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2.1.3 
Hierarchy Level: 5 
Brief Description: 
This process serves as a repository of all fraud classifications pertinent to the operator’s business model. 
Extended Description: 
The management and control of fraud classification information is an ongoing effort within any operator.  Not only is this information constantly growing 
internally within any given operator, but the available information externally is growing even more rapidly (other operators, industry standards and bodies, 
LEAs, etc.).  Management of this information is critical to the success and efficiency of any fraud protection program. 
 
Internal management tasks: 
1. Collection and version control of detected and confirmed frauds 
2. Management of M&Ps (Methods and Procedures) around each fraud type to: 
a. Detect (e.g., applicable rules) 
b. Investigate  
c Resolve (external interactions with LEAs service interruptions etc )


External management tasks: 
1. Access to fraud classifications and detection practices within the industry 
2. Access to fraud types that do not match the operator’s business model - fraud appearing in mobile technology may soon arrive in varied form in IPTV, fo
instance.  Access to a “library” of other fraud information will only benefit an operator over time.  Examples that may be shared within a library include: 
a. Hotlist B Database 
b. New fraud patterns 
c. New security and/or business loopholes exploited by fraudsters 
 
 Manage Internal Process Policies 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2.1.4 
Hierarchy Level: 5 
Brief Description: 
This process serves as a repository of  M&P (Methods and Procedures) information that maintains best practices for internal process navigation. 
Extended Description: 
Through the course of fraud program operations, other areas within the business will often need to be engaged as part of investigative actions, corrective 
actions, etc.  This process serves as the set of guidelines needed to understand at what points external support (outside of a fraud core team) is necessary
and what actions could be expected to be performed by those external teams.  This process will also contain pertinent contact information of trusted, 
qualified individuals within those external teams that may be used for fraud program work. 
 
 Manage LEA (Law Enforcement Agency) Interaction Policies 
Process Identifier: 1 7 9 2 1 5


y
Brief Description: 
This process serves as a repository of  M&P (Methods and Procedures) information for interactions with Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). 
Extended Description: 
Fraud teams will, from time to time, find it necessary to interact with LEAs for the purposes of investigating suspected fraud, understanding the scope of a 
fraud, understanding the legality of a fraud, assisting LEAs in placing a financial value on a fraud (to determine level of prosecution available), and to 
understand the syndicated network that may be involved.  Several pieces of information must be maintained within this process, including: 
 
1. Criteria for when LEAs should be involved in fraud response activities, including materials that may be supplied to support investigations without 
breaching confidentiality, etc. 
2. Criteria under which the operator can and should assist LEAs in their investigations (not initiated by the operator), including materials that may be 
supplied, confidentiality restrictions, SLAs, cost sharing, etc. 
3. Specific contacts within LEAs that may be utilized as liaisons 
4. Cases under which certain LEA jurisdictions should be contacted (e.g., city, regional, national, or international LEAs) 
5. Cases under which multiple levels of LEAs may be required to be engaged 
 
In situations where simple service interruption or collection actions are not enough to resolve the magnitude of a fraud case, LEAs serve as a valuable 
asset to not only compel fraudsters to cease activities and provide restitution, but to also prosecute more serious offenses and seize equipment, 
technology, and information that may have been used to perpetrate the fraud. 
 
 Manage External Operator Interaction Policies 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2.1.6 


y
Brief Description: 
This process serves as a repository of M&P (Methods and Procedures) information for interactions with External Operators. 
Extended Description: 
One of the key preventative measures available to any operator is information sharing with other operators.  Considering the number of operators globally 
today, there is a vast amount of information around fraud types, methods, detection practices, etc., that (if available between operators) could save 
considerable time, money, and effort within any given operator.  However, policies do need to be in place to guard against the sharing of sensitive 
information that could, in fact, harm the sharing operator.  This may include information that could benefit a competitor or trading partner, causing financial 
loss, decrease in market share, or exposure of competitive advantage. 
 
 Manage Internal Ethics Policies 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2.1.7 
Hierarchy Level: 5 
Brief Description: 
This process contains specific policies relating to internal staff conduct, and outlines what may be determined as a breach of that conduct and associated 
penalties. 
Extended Description: 
The success of an operator is determined by many factors.  One of the key factors relates to the experience and conduct of the internal staff.  Certain 
actions by internal staff could result in harm to the operator in terms of financial loss, loss of customers, or loss of sensitive internal information.  Policies 
need to be constructed and maintained within the operator that outline the conduct that is expected of employees, and also what is considered a breach, o
violation, of that conduct.  Additionally, penalties associated with breach or violation should also be explained within these policies (e.g., prosecution, 
termination, etc.).  Specific policy areas to address include, but are not limited to: 
 


2. Partner communications 
3. Customer communications 
4. System access and use 
 
This overall set of policies should be in the form of a document signed by all employees, and maintained within their employee records. 
 
Additional policies should also be maintained for Fraud Team members within the operator.  These policies should be included within an addendum 
document, signed by each Fraud Team member.  While all employees will have signed conduct agreements, staff working within a Fraud department will 
have access to particularly sensitive systems and information relating to internal and external fraud issues, which will require an increased level of 
confidentiality, privacy, and most importantly, security, beyond what general staff will be held accountable. 
  Support Fraud Management Operations 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2.2 
Hierarchy Level: 4 
Brief Description: 
Fraud Operations Support serves as the enabling function for fraud prevention, ongoing fraud detection, and overall threat reduction practices. 
Extended Description: 
Support Fraud Management Operations has a primary role as a preventative entity within Fraud Operations overall.  The Support process objective is to 
enable the ongoing detection, investigation and actions functions of Fraud Operations but also to support, in a proactive manner, the threats identification 
and Fraud avoidance functions through preventative information collection, monitoring the business for changes (and counsel the business when those 
changes expose a threat for fraud) and to manage fraud learnings back into the business via list , rule enhancements, etc.

 Process Information and Data 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2.2.1 
Hierarchy Level: 5 
Brief Description: 
This process is the ongoing processing of information and data against rules designed to detect threats, and the subsequent alerts and alarms resulting 
from rule violations and other detection processes. 
Extended Description: 
Fraud operations in general should be receiving data almost continuously, and analysis of the received data should take place without delay where 
possible.  Earlier processing and/or analysis of datasets enables not only more rapid detection of fraud, but also the subsequent ability to take meaningful 
action to stop fraudulent activities before (any) damage is incurred by the business.  There are 3 primary functional areas within this process to address an

Information and Data

tmf
1.7.9.2.2.3- Perform Fraud
Actions
tmf


1. Rule Processing:  During rule processing activities, information and data is passed through rules either through automated (technology-based) means or
other manual processes.  Depending on the volume of data and the complexity of the rules (interdependencies, aggregated or weighted triggering, etc.), 
increasing levels of technology will be necessary to quickly implement rules against data and determine the results. 
2. Alert Generation:  Configuration of alerts.  Alerts may be generated when certain expected conditions are not met, including missing dataset delivery, 
failure to act on investigation requests (escalations), etc.  Alerts may also be issued when certain conditions are exceeded, including excessive alarm 
quantities resulting from “loose” rules producing false positive results. 
3. Alarm Generation:  Configuration of alarms.  Alarms are typically the result of detected events or activities that are suspicious and should be investigated
as possible fraud.  Alarms may be the result of single rule violations, or of multiple rule violations that contribute to weighted levels of suspicion (more 
complex scenario) etc. 
 
Other functions may also include the configuration of supplementary reports for scenarios not configured through rules and alarms as listed above. 
 
The configuration of rules, alerts, and alarms should be governed by policies as described in the 1.1.x processes for Fraud Management.  Additionally, the 
procedures that should be followed as a result of the issuance of an alert or alarm should be governed by policies as described within the 1.1.x processes 
for Fraud Management. 
 
 Analyze Fraud 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2.2.2 
Hierarchy Level: 5

linear flow that also includes feedback into action and support processes, as described below. 
 
1. Alarm Assessment:  As data processing triggers alarms of suspected fraud, the assessment activity is the first point at which initial triage of the alarm(s) 
is conducted.   During the assessment, the analyst should determine, based on business rules, the initial validity of the alarm, a priority of the alarm (based
on value, affected systems, or other criteria), and the appropriate team that would need to address the alarm (e.g., billing, wholesale partner, network, etc.)
2. Alarm Investigation:  Once initial assessment has occurred, the alarm is then forwarded to an investigation activity that typically begins as an internal 
function.   During investigation additional data may be accessed, scope of the issue may be ascertained, and an overall understanding of the issue will 
need to be achieved before determining whether the issue is, in fact, fraud.  During this process initial actions may be invoked (e.g., disrupted service) to 
prevent further loss/risk prior to customer contact and/or fraud determination work. 
3. Contact Customer:  Once internal investigations have gathered all information available, a customer contact may be necessary to understand customer 
intention, validity of the subscriber, etc.  This is the final process performed prior to reaching a fraud decision.  If no customer is directly involved, this step 
may not be necessary (e.g., Dealer Fraud, Internal Fraud). 
4. Fraud Determination:  Once all information is collected from internal and external investigations, a fraud determination is made.  If the decision is that the
issue is not fraud, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Fraud Actions process (1.2.3) for closure, and the Support process 
(1.3.3) for enhancement of rules and configurations to possibly avoid recurrence of this alarm condition.  If the decision is that the issue is, in fact fraud, 
similar subsequent activities will occur:  First, the issue is referred to the Fraud Actions (1.2.3) process to properly handle actions to stop the fraud, initiate 
collections and legal actions, etc.  Second, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Support process (1.3.3) for enhancement of 
rules and configurations to hotlists, blacklists, and any refinement needed to possibly capture the issue more rapidly. 
5. Recording and Reporting:  After the determination is made as fraud or not fraud, activities associated with the analysis are finally passed into recording o
actions, and reporting of recoveries, time to capture and correct, and preventative actions now in process. 
 
 Perform Fraud Actions 
Process Identifier: 1.7.9.2.2.3 
Hierarchy Level: 5 


p
This process contains all possible actions necessary to manage an issue following determination as fraud or not fraud. 
Extended Description: 
Fraud Actions is comprised of a series of sub processes that act as guidelines for activities to be performed based on the issue being determined as fraud 
or not fraud.  Each sub process is capable of being a stand-alone process (not dependent on other Actions sub processes), however more than one of 
these Actions may be used to help bring any given issue to appropriate closure. 
 
1. No Action:  If an issue is determined to not be fraud, the issue is closed and archived as part of this process.  Concurrent flows to Support and Reporting
have also occurred to adjust rules, etc., as a result.  No further action is required.  Note:  A feedback to the System Configuration Management process 
should be considered in this case, for possible alarm threshold adjustment, whitelist updates, etc.  This process path is denoted in Figure 5:  “Overall 
Process”. 
2. Adjust Customer Billing:  Certain fraud instances result in customers being the victim in addition to the operator.  In these cases, extent of customer 
damage needs to be quickly ascertained and corrected in the customer’s billing and/or services.  While the determination of the damage is typically 
performed by the fraud team, the actual Customer Billing corrective action is usually performed by a Customer Care Team, based on information forwarded
by the Fraud Team. 
3. Legal or LEA (Law Enforcement Agency) Action:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and significant financial loss, contract breach, or other illegal 
activities have occurred, the operator may seek recourse via the legal system.  This may be via civil reparations and/or criminal charges.  This sub process
will utilize the operator’s policies (1.1.5) to determine whether attorney, law enforcement, or other assistance is needed.  This sub process will also use the
same policies to determine and collect supporting information that will be necessary for those external agencies to properly pursue their activities. 
4. Terminate Customer:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and the operator deems the issue to be of enough magnitude to warrant termination, this 
process will conduct the termination of the customer (e.g., initiate the disconnect order). 
5. Dismiss Staff:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and/or a substantial violation of internal operator policies and internal staff have been found 
responsible, termination of the staff may be initiated at this step.  Fraud team findings for ethics policy violations, fraud investigative results, etc., should be
forwarded to Human Resources, where appropriate actions will be initiated.  Of important note:  Staff negligence resulting in fraud is sometimes 
inappropriately diagnosed as intentional when, in fact, accidental actions may have exposed the operator to the fraud.  Care should be taken to fully

enhancements.  Business process may have, in fact, allowed the fraud to occur, therefore the first step in prevention should happen well before a rule 
should capture the condition.  This process will need to interface with the business to identify candidates for process change and present those to the 
appropriate business stakeholders.

The objective of the Manage a Transformation Assurance Framework  process is to establish an enterprise-wide transformation assurance policy 
framework, and an associated operational capability aimed at ensuring risks along change and transformation are recognized, owned, understood and 
actively managed to minimize financial and customer impact during transformation projects. The Transformation Assurance  process focusses on providing
consultancy within change  processes in the enterprise and transparency on early identified risks, their assignment, assessment and defining build-in 
controls for enabling “error-free” transformation. For handling this role of a consultant during the transformation projects, a standard Business Assurance 
Change  methodology can be defined that starts from project assessment to identify the risk areas and risk level, standard Business Assurance 
requirements for “build-in” controls, standard Business Assurance requirements for data export and proceeding to project specific requirements.

Extended Description: 
Security Management processes assess threats to the enterprise and provide capabilities and controls to minimize the threats identified. These processes 
are responsible for setting Security Management corporate policies, guidelines, best practices and auditing for compliance by the enterprise.  In the 
information and communications technology (ICT) service provider domain, Security Management is a systematic and continuous series of processes and 
behaviors which assure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Enterprise’s critical ICT assets. For ICT service providers, such assets can also 
include customer and partner data and resources.  Effective Security Management is essential for an ICT service provider to meet its fiduciary and legal 
obligations, business/mission objectives, and customer expectations.  Security Management addresses both internal and external sources of security 
threats as it provides computer network protection and defensive services.  Security Management processes include:1) Prevention;  2) Monitoring ; 3) 
Analysis; 4) Detection 5) Incident Management. 
 
Security management deals with enterprise exposure to loss of value or reputation through threats or security violations.  Proactive Security Management 
processes identify areas of threat to the enterprise (covering both internal and external sources of threat), and monitor industry trends and best practice 
approaches to ensure that the enterprise remains at the forefront of security management threat minimization. Areas of threat can be physical (e.g. break-
ins or terrorist incident, inappropriate use of network) or logical (e.g. inappropriate access to and use of information technology). The processes support the
categorization and prioritization of areas of threat. These processes define the policies, guidelines, practices and procedures to be followed and provide 
assistance to the enterprise operational areas to deploy appropriate physical infrastructure, procedures and monitoring capabilities.  Reactive Security 
management processes deal with the establishment of tools and data collection capabilities to capture details of operation activity, analysis of monitored

Security Management processes interface to external security, police and/or investigative organizations.  These processes strongly interact with Fraud 
Management and have common elements and information services and communications specific elements.   Security Management processes are 
implemented at many levels of the enterprise and at the user, system/network, etc. levels.  Note that the actual security monitoring, control and 
management procedures and facilities are embedded in the operational infrastructure and processes defined and deployed within the SIP and Operations 
process areas.  Note that Audit Management processes provide assurance that the necessary control structures are in place, and provide an estimate to 
the extent to which the procedures are followed and are effective.
