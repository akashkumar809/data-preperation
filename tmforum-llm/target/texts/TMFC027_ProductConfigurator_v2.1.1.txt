Product 
Configurator 
TMFC027 The Product Configurator aims to provide 
sales representatives and customers with 
fast and error-free product qualification and 
product configuration capabilities across all 
channels. 
It uses mostly the Product Catalog and the 
Product Inventory information, and is able 
to execute and check all types of Product 
Catalog policy rules (e.g. packaging rules, 
commercial pre-requisite rules, pricing 
rules, consistency rules between 
characteristic values). It can also use Party 
related information, such as the age of the 
customer, or specific contextual 
information, such as the channel. 
It can be triggered in contexts such as 
product order capture, shopping cart or 
quote management. It supports the Product 
Order Capture and Validation component 
(TMFC002) to: 
• 
Establish commercial offering 
eligibility, and to provide alternative 
product offerings in case of 
ineligible product offering selection 
• 
Leads the configuration of selected 
eligible product offerings according 
to the context. Product configuration 
includes computation of 
characteristics values, allowed 
values, bundled and related product 
offering, pricing and discounts

Management 
Configuration Management configures or creates a 
new version of a configuration for an entity, such as 
a product,service or resource, as defined by a 
configuration specification. This process also 
modifies a configuration and values for configuration 
parameters, and removes a configuration. 
1.2.5.2 L3 
Manage Product 
Configuration 
Manage Product Configuration business activity is in 
charge of creating, maintaining, controlling, 
changing and reporting Product Configuration 
according to Product Configuration Plans. 
Manage Product Configuration will establish and 
maintaining consistency of a product's performance, 
functional, and physical attributes within the limits 
defined by product requirements, product design, 
and operational information throughout the Products 
Lifecycle.

Definition 
Product 
Configurati
on 
A Product Configuration (also referred to 
as a Product Profile) defines how a 
Product operates or functions. 
A Product Configuration may contain one 
or more parts, and each part may contain 
zero or more fields. Each field may have 
attributes that are statically or dynamically 
defined. Some of these fields have fixed 
values, while others provide values from 
which a choice or choices can be made 
(e.g. using the EntitySpec/Entity and/or 
CharacteristicSpec/CharacteristicValue 
patterns) 1

1 As in GB922 Product v23.0 document the definition of the ABE Product Configuration 
is a copy of the Configuration ABE pattern defined in GB922 Common v23.0, it is here 
adapted to the product level only. 
*: if SID ABE Level 2 is not specified this means that all the L2 business entities must 
be implemented, else the L2 SID ABE Level is specified.

3.3. Events  
The diagram illustrates the Events which the component publishes and the Events that 
the component subscribes to and then receives. Both lists are derived from the APIs 
listed in the preceding sections. 
The type of event could be: 
• 
Create : a new resource has been created (following a POST). 
• 
Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. 
• 
AttributeValueChange: an attribute from the resource has changed - event 
structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing 
to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
StateChange: resource state has changed.
