Introduction 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Communication management. It includes the model 
definition as well as all available operations. 
 
It provides a standardized mechanism for Communication management such as creation, update, retrieval, deletion and 
notification of the system communication events. 
Communication API manages the following data resources: 
- 
Communication Message 
o Communication message means a notification approach in the format of a message which can be 
dispatched (sent) to the certain user by the system with the content which can be felt and understood by 
the recipient. The user can be either a final customer or a customer service agent. The message can 
reach the customer in different interaction channels, including: email, short message, mobile app 
notification (push).  
Normally the communication is implemented as a common shared service for all the IT applications. 
Whenever there is an application which needs to manage or send the message to the customer, this 
application can invoke the “communication” API to dispatch the notification. 
 
To help clarify the concept of “communication API”, here all the possible “man-machine” contact 
approaches are listed as below. The “tick” shows the interaction types for which the “communication 
API” is designed to support. 
 
Business Interaction Method 
Communication API Related 
SMS to customer 
√ 
Email to customer 
√ 
Mobile app push message to customer 
√ 
Proactive calling to the customer  
(human initiated, i.e. person-call-person) 
 
Proactive calling to the customer 
(system initiated, i.e. machine-call-person) 
 
Face to face contact 
 
Customer browsing web page, open mobile app, 
calling IVR etc. 
 
 


Communication API performs the following operation on the resource of “Communication Message”.  There are two 
types of operations provided in this API. One is the management of the request message body. Another is for sending the 
communication message to the customer. 
 
Operations for Communication Message body management 
- 
Retrieval of an existing Communication Message depending on filter criteria 
- 
Creation of a new Communication Message 
- 
Partial update of an existing Communication Message 
- 
Deletion of an existing Communication Message  
- 
Notification of events: 
o Creation of Communication Message  
o Updating Communication Message 
o Deletion of Communication Message 
 
Operations for sending Communication Message. 
- 
Send a message, including: 
o Send a new message with the whole communication message body (POST operation) 
o Send a message with the predefined communication message body (PATCH operation) 
 
MAPPING WITH SID ABE 
Communication Message is mapped to “Business Interaction ABE:: Notification ABE” in TMF Information 
Framework (SID). 
The Business Interaction ABE is illustrated as the diagram below:

MAPPING WITH ETOM PROCESS 
Communication API can be mapped to the “Customer Interaction Management” in TM Forum Process Framework 
(eTOM).  
The relevant process is:  Notify Customer. 
 
The definition of TM Forum Process Framework is: 
Category: (3) eTOM Process Type  
Process Identifier: 1.3.5.5  
Original Process Identifier: 1.1.1.18.5  
Maturity Level: 4  
Description 
Notify the customer when interesting events happen.  
Extended Description 
The purpose of this process is to notify the customer when events related to existing interactions or to significant 
customer experience happen. Some notifications can be sent immediately using interactive media (such as SMS, 
Push to applications, etc.) and other notifications can be sent later using asynchronous media such as mail. 
 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THIS API AND EVENT MANAGEMENT API 
This API and Event Management API own some similarities.  


The distinctions between them are explained in the table below: 
Comparison Points 
Communication API 
Event Management API 
Definition 
Communication message means a 
message which can be dispatch (sent) to 
the certain user by the system in the 
format which can be felt and 
understood by the recipient 
An Event represents a change in the state of a 
configuration item, service or business data 
entity 
User Role 
Sender: Enterprise (e.g. TelCo).   
Receiver:  Customer, agent, O&M staff 
IT System.   
No natural person (customer or agent) is 
involved.  
Business Scenario 
The enterprise needs to send the 
notification information to the 
customer or the agent. 
Note: It is used to support the direct 
interaction with the users. 
 
It can signal status changes or exceptions that 
allow the appropriate person or system to 
perform early response actions to ensure 
service performance and continuity or used as 
a trigger for automation run books. 
Note: It is used to manage the intrinsic event 
inside the system. The event is always created 
in the EM backend referring to the internal 
Event Management system.  
Relevant IT System 
Interaction or contact module of the 
system 
Any module inside the IT system

Communication API 
Event Management API 
Data Model 
Content of communication message. 
The content is visible to the user 
(customer, et al) 
The description of how an event is triggered 
and handled.  
It has no “content” to contain the concrete 
communication message information. The 
“related object” in this API does not distinctly 
express the meaning of content. The “related 
object” could be the “attachment” of the 
message. 
It has no “sender” and “receiver” for the 
communication message information. The 
explanation of “related party” in this API has an 
example which is “assignee support group”. It 
shows this API parameter is used to depict who 
is the “event handler”.

Mapping  
Common Business Entities Domain 
Business Interaction ABE 
Notification Entity 
A communication that informs about 
something that has or will happen. A 
Notification is typically one-sided, in 
that no Response is expected. A 
Notification can be created as the result 
of a Request. 
Common Business Entities Domain 
Event ABE 
The Event ABE contains entities that are used 
to represent events, their occurrence and their 
recording within systems. 
Operation 
1) CRUD of communication message in 
IT system, i.e., create, read, update and 
deletion. 
2) Send the communication message to 
the user 
Create event (i.e. trigger the event) in the 
system. 
Query event 
Update event 


Comparison Points 
Communication API 
Event Management API 
Relationship 
In the widest conception, any system action can be an event, such as the creation of new 
offering, execution of order, adding one item into the shopping cart. On this level, the 
“communication message” is also an event. 
In the narrow conception, event is for the technical terminology to describe the one-off 
change of the certain module, such as an event of “memory stack overflow” or “switch the 
web server”. Such event is collected by the Event Manager to monitor the status of whole 
running system.  
According to the definition of Event Management API, this API focuses more on the 
second concept. “Communication” is also taking place in one-off mode, but it expresses 
the interactive human-machine contact instead of the pure system action. 
 
 
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THIS API AND CHANGE REQUEST API 
This API and Change Request API own some similarities.  
The distinctions between them are explained in the table below: 
Comparison Points 
Communication API 
Change Management API 
Definition 
Communication message means a 
message which can be dispatch 
(sent) to the certain user by the 
system in the format which can be 
felt and understood by the 
recipient 
Change Management process is to respond to the 
customer’s changing business requirements. 
The Change Management API provides the standard 
integration capabilities between external 
applications and Change Management Application 
User Role 
Sender: Enterprise (e.g. TelCo).   
Receiver:  Customer, agent, O&M 
staff 
The involved roles of the API can be: 
- 
Change Management Application 
- 
External application 
 No natural person (customer or agent) is involved.

Business Scenario 
The enterprise needs to send the 
notification information to the 
customer or the agent. 
Note: It is used to support the 
direct interaction with the users.

Data Model 
Inherit from “Business Interaction”. 
Content of communication 
message. The content is visible to 
the user (customer, et al). 
Inherit from “Business Interaction”. 
nota bene:  The “Business Interaction” has a group 
of derivative objects. “Change Request” is mapped 
to “request” object, not “notification”. 
Additionally, this API data model contains: 
- 
Attachment: This is also included in 
Communication API 
- 
Related Party: The role which is involved. This is 
also included in Communication API 
- 
Target Entity, Impacted Entity: both are 
referred to “realted party”. 
- 
Work log 
 
If the work log is a type of task for the 
staff to execute, it is not required in 
Communication API 
 
If the work log is the pure log (record) of 
the system action, it is a default function 
of the system. Communication API has 
the “log flag” to indicate whether the log 
should be generated after invoking API.  
The detail of the log is not required to be 
explicitly expressed in Communication 
API 
- 
Note: It is an optional attribute. In 
Communication API, the “content” is used to 
describe the purpose of the communication 
message.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base 
entities, for instance an EnhancedCommunicationMessage inheriting properties from the CommunicationMessage 
entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Design Guidelines. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity.  All resources and sub-resources 
of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred 
class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself and not 
the class type of the referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not 
useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

Notification Resource Models 
 
2 notifications are defined for this API 
Notifications related to CommunicationMessage: 
    - CommunicationMessageAttributeValueChangeEvent 
    - CommunicationMessageStateChangeEvent 
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure 
containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the 
resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the 
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder).

Patch communication message 
  PATCH /communicationMessage/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a communication message entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null} 
 
 
 


Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be replaced by 
one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY 
refers to the data structure of the given notification type. 


 
Request 
 
POST /client/listener 
Accept: application/json 
 
{ 
    "event": {  
                EVENT BODY  
            }, 
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE" 
} 
 
 
Response 
 
201
