Resource Discovery and Reconciliation 
provides functionality to scan the 
network for new managed resources 
and changes in existing managed 
resources using technology specific 
protocols. It supports reconciling the 
discovered information with the 
Resource Inventory. It will instanciate 
Resources in the Resource Inventory 
according to the business rules defined 
in the resource onboarding 
configuration.

Functional Framework Functions 
2.1. eTOM business activities 
<Note to not be inserted onto ODA Component specifications: If a new ABE is 
required, but it does not yet exist in SID. Then you should include a textual description 
of the new ABE, and it should be clearly noted that this ABE does not yet exist. In 
addition a Jira epic should be raised to request the new ABE is added to SID, and the 
SID team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the 
component without this ABE. If the ABE is critical then the component specification 
should not be published until the ABE issue has been resolved. Alternatively if the ABE 
is not critical, then the specification could continue to publication. The result of this 
decision should be clearly recorded.>

SID ABEs this ODA Component is responsible for: 
 
SID ABE Level 1 
SID ABE Level 2 (or set of BEs)* 
Resource Topology ABE 
 
*: if SID ABE Level 2 is not specified this means that all the L2 business entities must 
be implemented, else the L2 SID ABE Level is specified.

Network Resources Scanning 
functions are responsible for 
discovering the resources and their 
details throughout a management 
channel. These functions may 
either directly communicate with the 
Network resources or communicate 
through a Resource Domain 
Manager. The functions should be 
able to support retrieving the overall 
resource information or the detailed 
resource information which can 
include sub-components.

Resource Inventory Reconciliation 
Function entails a reconciling 
function for the Repository with 
inventory discovered from another 
source (typically, the network). 
When new inventory information is 
discovered, this is tried to be 
matched with an entity or entities 
already known and updated 
accordingly and if there is no match 
then new information is created. It 
can work periodically or on demand 
in real-time.

3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events 
 
The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. At 
this stage we list the APIs, resource and operation we no mention to optionally 
(in other word no mention about mandatory VS optional resource) 
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs. At this stage no optionally 
is defined and none of this 'required' API is listed as 'mandatory' 
• 
List of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may 
consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each 
defined event. 
 
<Note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is 
required, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the 
new Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In 
addition, a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the 
Open API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of 
the component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component 
specification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. 
Alternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to 
publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.>

3.3. Events 
The diagram illustrates the Events which the component may publish and the Events 
that the component may subscribe to and then may receive. Both lists are derived from 
the APIs listed in the preceding sections.
