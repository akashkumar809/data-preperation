 Introduction
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Party Management. It
includes the model definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are
creating, updating and retrieving parties (individuals or organizations), including filtering.
Party is an abstract concept that represents an individual (person) or an organization that
has any kind of relation with the enterprise.
Party is created to record an individual or an organization before the assignment of any role.
The actual role(s) that the party plays in its relationship with the enterprised are represented
by the Party Role API.
More generally, this API plays an important role in the global party domain relating to
TMF672 Roles and Permissions API, TMF669 Party Role Management API, TMF629
Customer Management API, TMF720 Digital Identity Management API, TMF691 Federated
Identity API and TMF639 Resource Management API, to managing and controlling access to
information and resources within an organization or network.
In summary, these TM Forum Open APIs are related to managing parties and their
associated roles and digital identities within a network, as well as controlling access to
information and resources through user roles and permissions. They provide a standardized
way for organizations to manage these processes and enable integration with other systems.
The following diagram illustrates the involved entities in a global party domain overview,
referencing related TM Forum Open APIs and resource model entities:
The Party API manages the following data resources:
Individual
• Individual represents a single human being (a man, woman or child). The individual can


 be a customer, an employee or any other person that the organization needs to store
information about.
Organization
• Organization represents a group of people identified by shared interests or purpose.
Examples include business, department and enterprise. Because of the complex nature
of many businesses, both organizations and organization units are represented by the
same data.
The party API performs the following operations on individuals and organizations:
• Retrieval of an individual or an organization
• List a collection of individuals or organization depending on filter criteria
• Partial update of an individual or an organization
• Creation of an individual or an organization
• Deletion of an individual or an organization
• Notification of events relating to an individual or an organization.


 Sample Use Cases
To illustrate JSON representation of resources concerned by this API, we use the two use
cases detailed below.
Use case 1 (UC1): An individual employee of an organization
• + *
Use case 2 (UC2): a company (organization) with two departments (organizations)


 


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a PricingRequest and
Quoting inheriting properties from the abstract Quote entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 document.
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Quote instances some may be instances of PricingRequest where
other could be instances of Quoting. The @type gives this information. All resources and
sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a QuoteRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
PricingRequestRef or QuotingRef, and not the class type of the referred object. However
since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference
objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

Notification Resource Models
8 notifications are defined for this API.
Notifications related to Individual:
• Individual Delete Event
• Individual Create Event
• Individual State Change Event
• Individual Attribute Value Change Event
Notifications related to Organization:
• Organization Delete Event
• Organization Attribute Value Change Event
• Organization State Change Event
• Organization Create Event
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the
figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub
class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId),
an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification
structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field
("resourceName" placeholder).

Usage samples
Here's a sample of a request for creating an Organization resource. In this example the
request only passes mandatory attributes.
Request
POST /organization
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "@type": "Organization",
  "@baseType": "Party",
  "name": "Coffee Do Brazil"
}
Response

  "@type": "Organization",
  "@baseType": "Party",
  "name": "Coffee Do Brazil",
  "status": "initialized"
}
Updates partially a Organization
PATCH /organization/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of an Organization entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

Deletes a Organization
DELETE /organization/{id}
Description
This operation deletes an Organization entity.


 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
201
For detailed examples on the general TM Forum notification mechanism, see the TMF REST
Design Guidelines.
