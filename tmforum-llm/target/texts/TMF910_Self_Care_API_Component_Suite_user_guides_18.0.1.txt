1.2. 
USE CASES 
1.2.1. 
USER MANAGES HIS ACCOUNT 
The user opens the application and identifies the elements that he can manage (customer 
entities, billing accounts and subscribed products). 
 
The user selects one of the subscribed products, for instance a mobile line, and checks the 
usage consumption tab in order to understand how many messages can still send or data 
consume till the end of the period. 
 
The user selects one of the subscribed products, for instance a mobile line, and checks the 
latest calls performed and received as well as the data transferred in the last days. 
 
The user selects one of his billing accounts (probably identified as the one where a given 
product is billed) and downloads the latest bill as well as compare with previous bills. 
 
1.2.2. 
USER UPDATES HIS OFFER 
The user checks the “special offers” area in the application and looks for an offer that is 
better than his current plan. 
 
The user finds a new offer that is appealing and requests the change of plan to subscribe to 
the new offer. 
 
The new offer is added to the list of subscribed products.  
 
1.2.3. 
USER RAISES AN ISSUE 
The user checks his last bill and is not convinced that the charged amount is appropriate. 
 


 
© TM Forum 2018. All Rights Reserved
Page 10 of 27
The user wants to dispute the bill and opens an issue (a commercial ticket) to initiate the 
claim. 
 
The new issue is added to the list of issues already open by the user. 
 
After some time, the user checks the status of the complaint in the app to understand if it 
has been resolved and the resolution details.

application  
 
postCondition: The identity information related to the individual using the application that 
has logged in 
 
error: Token is invalid 
 
 
getAssets 
 
precondition: The application makes use of an Open ID Connect operation to authenticate 
and obtain a ticket to request identity information for the individual (user) making use of the 
application  
 
postCondition: The list of assets, or manageable entities (e.g.: customer, account or 
telephone line number) that the individual using the application can manage

error: None identified. The identifier of the account (accountId) should be valid because it is 
known before hand by the application as defined in the precondition  
 
 
getBillInfo 
 
precondition: The application is aware of the bill resources whose information can be 
requested via function getBills being previously invoked
