- Product Specification Development & 
Retirement and Product Offering Development & 
Retirement processes are used to manage most 
of the lifecycle of product specifications and 
product offerings. This is done to eliminate

the prices associated with on-boarded product 
offerings. 
- This process therefore focuses on managing 
the relationship that parties, including the 
enterprise, have with product specifications and 
product offerings as well as the impact of off-
boarding specifications and offerings on a 
provider's service and resource infrastructure.

The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. 
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs. 
• 
List of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may 
consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each 
defined event.

 Functional Framework 
 ISA-996 - Master Data Management has repurposed catalog related 
functions  BACKLOG  
As part of reviewing the Product, Service and Resource Catalogs to align with the 
updates to the Functional Framework, we realized that a lot of functions have either 
been removed or been re-purposed by Master Data Management.  
Due to this, we had to make a decision to remove all these functions from the 
Components:  
• 
Removed deleted unclassified functions  (1,2,5,7,9,10, 12,14,15) 
• 
Removed functions that used to be related to Catalog management but now 
have been re-purposed by Master Data Management ((3,4, 6,11,13) 
Our concern is that we may be missing functions for the catalog due to re-use of 
Master Data Management.  
5.2.2. 
Open APIs 
Work in progress to create a Product Usage API (as Service Usage and Resource 
Usage APIs) - when ready, it would be added to the exposed APIs for the usage
