Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for ServiceQualification management. It includes the 
model definition as well as all available operations.  
In the Open Digital Economy where multiple actors (SDPs, CSPs, …) may be involved with the delivery of an end-to-
end service, those actors need to collaborate and interact with the customer as needed. 
Following diagram shows ServiceQualification API within pre-ordering API package: 
 
Service Qualification API is one of Pre-Ordering Management API Family. Service Qualification API goal is to provide 
service technical eligibility in the context of the interaction. This API allows to: 
• 
Request a specific service (of an array of service) eligibility providing as an input configured service. The 
resource checkServiceQualification is used for this purpose. The requester will provide an array of service 
qualification item and expect to have a qualification result for each one of them. In the response, the API 
will provide qualification result but also: 
• 
Eligibility unavailability reason (if any) 
• 
Alternate service proposal (if any). 
• 
Look for retrieving service available depending on criteria providing in the request – The main UC is to 
provide a service category and a place for example and get in the response all available service. In the 
request the requested provided searchCiteria(s) – in response requester get this search criteria plus an 
array of serviceQualificationItem for each service available. Note that if no service are available, no error 
will be triggered and no serviceQualificationItem will be in the answer (only searchCriteria are in the 
response) 
Because the API allows describing service from the inventory, it is also possible to use it to retrieve service 
available to complete existing service for both resources. 
This API did not trigger any modification on the service in the inventory – in particular the service state is not 
changed (no shift to eligibilityCheck) 


In the request, for both resources, the following attributes could be filled: 
• 
service, serviceSpecification, category or service characteristics will be indicated (at least one is 
mandatory), 
• 
relatedParty, for which the qualification must be done, 
• 
place, where the customer wants his service, 
• 
expected qualification date. 
Lifecycle 
The state machine specifying the typical state change transitions is provided below. This is standard task based 
resource lifecycle: 
 


SAMPLE USE CASES 
To provide some use-cases: 
For checkServiceQualification: 
• 
Check if we can deliver a 4k TV service at a specified address 
• 
Check if we can deliver new IP TV service at the same location of an existing and active Access service  (i.e. 
without explicitly specifying address but using service relationship) 
• 
Check if we can upgrade the download speed of an existing and active service from 100 Mb/s to 600Mb/s 
 
For queryServiceQualification: 
• 
Retrieve a list of service specification – from a service category - available at a given place 
• 
Retrieve a list of service specification connecteable to an existing service 


Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base 
entities, for instance a ServiceEligibility and TechnicalEligibility inheriting properties from the abstract 
CheckServiceQualification entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
CheckServiceQualification instances some may be instances of ServiceEligibility where other could be instances of 
TechnicalEligibility. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type 
attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a CheckServiceQualificationRef object) 
to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when 
used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as ServiceEligibilityRef or TechnicalEligibilityRef, and not 
the class type of the referred object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally 
not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

Patch check service qualification 
  PATCH /checkServiceQualification/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a check service qualification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

Patch query service qualification 
  PATCH /queryServiceQualification/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a query service qualification entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Delete query service qualification 
  DELETE /queryServiceQualification/{id} 
Description 
This operation deletes a query service qualification entity. 
 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for deleting a QueryServiceQualification. 
 
Request

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines part 1. Refer to the guidelines for more details. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null} 
 
 


Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be replaced by 
one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY 
refers to the data structure of the given notification type. 


 
Request 
 
POST /client/listener 
Accept: application/json 
 
{ 
    "event": {  
                EVENT BODY  
            }, 
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE" 
} 
 
 
Response 
 
201
