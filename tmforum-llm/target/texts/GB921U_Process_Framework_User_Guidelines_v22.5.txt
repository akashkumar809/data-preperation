Executive Summary 
This document is an Application Note attached to The Business Process Framework (GB921). It is intended to 
provide users of the Business Process Framework (eTOM) with guidelines and information to assist them in 
applying the Business Process Framework within their businesses. 
 
21.5 Release notice 
PLEASE NOTE: 
Because of some major adjustments to domains in ODA and additional structural changes to the Business 
Process Framework, significant amendments to diagrams and text has commenced. It is expected to be 
completed in subsequent releases. The interim state may cause inconsistencies in this and other ODA 
documents. Specifically, there are known diagram depictions, term conflicts, and numbering issues that are 
being addressed. 
 


1. Introduction 
This document explains the design decisions of the Business Process Framework and sets out the 
principles for its application and extension in the form of Guidelines. These Guidelines are of use in two 
particular cases. First, for the practitioner or process architect who wants to apply the Business Process 
Framework in a consistent way to specific situations. Second, for assurance of auditing and traceability, 
in order to produce repeatable application of the Business Process Framework within an organization 
and to demonstrate this externally for audit purposes. 
It also provides a basis for contributors to the Business Process Framework and the evaluation of 
contributions by the Business Process Framework team. Note that the concepts in this document have 
emerged throughout the development lifecycle of the Business Process Framework itself, and as a 
consequence, historical design decisions that are embedded within the Business Process Framework 
may deviate from the recommended practice herein that is intended to guide ongoing users of the 
Framework. The intent is to converge the practice here with the Business Process Framework as it is 
developed further, but users should recognize that this will be an evolving situation. 
It is intended that the guidance in this document will be augmented through user experience and 
feedback. A list of outstanding issues is included. 
1.1  Audience 
The intended audience for the Guidelines is practitioners, process architects, and process 
auditors. The material here is advanced material - it is not introductory (as that information is 
available elsewhere in the Business Process Framework set). 
1.2  Plan of document 
The document is set out as follows: 
 The principles and positions of the Business Process Framework model 
 Process patterns 
 Relationship of the Business Process Framework to ODA and the ODA elements 
 Business Process Framework and an organization’s own processes 
 Guidance for extending and using the Business Process Framework 
 Audit checklist 
 
 


1.3  Principles and Guidelines 
The principles are shown in the following format. Optionally, a Best Practice Guideline is 
indicated where a recommendation is made about the way in which the Business Process 
Framework should be applied. Requirements for auditing purposes are also shown in this 
format.

2. Principles and positions of the Business Process 
Framework model 
2.1  Introduction 
This section sets out to position the Business Process Framework as a process framework and 
to make explicit the modeling and design choices which have been followed in its development. 
2.2 A note on the status of the Business Process Framework documentation 
The Business Process Framework consists of both normative and non-normative material. The 
normative material is the Standard; the non-normative material is included for information and 
guidance. In general, GB921, with its Annexes and Addenda is normative material; Appendices 
and Application Notes are non-normative. Process Descriptions in Addendum D and DX, 
Process Flow Examples in Addendum F and E are all normative. Other TMF documents, such as 
GB939 (Business Services Examples), which include Business Process Framework material, are 
non-normative. 
There is, however, an important distinction between the Process Elements (PEs), presented in 
Addendum D and DX, and the Process Flows, presented in Addendum F and E. Both are 
normative, i.e., part of the Standard, but the Process Elements are comprehensive in scope 
while the Process Flows are examples. 
2.3  Nature of the Business Process Framework model 
The Business Process Framework is a set of Process Elements, which are organized into a 
hierarchical framework. The Process Elements are activity-based, and the Business Process 
Framework is thus an activity-based process decomposition model. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 01 
Business Process Framework is an activity/task-based process decomposition model. 
 
The Process Elements in the Business Process Framework are intended as an exhaustive list; 
they are comprehensive in scope. It is the intent that all business activities and tasks in the 
Enterprise can be supported by (i.e., are able to fit within) the Business Process Framework 
Process Elements. Each Process Element has a detailed description that can include the 
purpose, inputs, outputs, interfaces, high level information and functional requirements and 
business rules. 
 


p
Business Process Framework Process Elements are comprehensive for a Service 
Provider. 
 
Note: 
The Business Process Framework is a process model, not a state model. It contains processes, 
not states. For example, it contains process definition and decomposition for the processes of 
Order Handling but does not model the different states of an Order. 
 2.4 Process model types 
In general, there are 3 approaches to the modeling of business processes. It is also possible to 
use a hybrid of these approaches. The general approaches are: 
 activity-based process modeling 
 communication-based process modeling  
 artifact-based process modeling  
 
Activity-based process modelling 
Here the overall process is decomposed into tasks that are ordered based on the dependencies 
among them. The fundamental entity of a business process for the Activity-based approach is 
the unit of work and a business process is considered to be a succession of activities, or units 
of work, following a specific control flow.  
Definition: Activity 
An activity represents a unit of work performed by a party or system. Activities transform inputs 
into outputs and are associated with triggers and outcomes (pre and post conditions).  
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 03 
A Business Process Framework Process Element is a succession of activities with a 
control flow. 
 
Communication-based Process Modelling 
In this approach, an action in a process flow is represented by the communication that flows 
from a provider toward a consumer (In process improvement, a SIPOC is a tool that summarizes 
the 
inputs 
and 
outputs 
of 
one 
or 
more 
processes 
in 
terms 
of: 
Supplier=>Input=>Process=>Output=>Consumer). In the communication-based approach the 
communication is the message. So, a business process can be expressed as an exchange of 
messages, or transaction, between two or more roles and every state change within a company 
can be associated with the processing of a message.  


In the artifact-based approach objects, or artifacts, are created, modified and used during the 
process and thus the model is based on work products and their paths through a series of 
workflow activities.  
Hybrid approach to Process Modelling 
The hybrid approach uses a combination of these general approaches to produce a set of 
models for an organization’s processes. Typical models might be based on an information flow 
model (from the communication-based approach), a capabilities model (from the artifact-
based approach) and a process-model (activity-based approach).  
2.5 Characteristics of a Business Process 
In general, a Business Process will have the following characteristics: 
 It has a goal 
 It has specific inputs 
 It has specific outputs 
 It transforms inputs into outputs 
 It uses resources 
 It has several activities that are performed in some order 
 It creates value of some kind for the customer. The customer may be internal or 
external. 
In addition: 
 It may affect more than one organizational unit - “Horizontal organizational 
impact” 
 Its effects on information entities can be analyzed via CRUD (Create / Read / 
Update / Delete) 
 It may have a responsibility model for the roles associated with the process, 
expressible as RACI Characteristics (Responsible / Accountable / Consulted / 
Informed) 
For a Business Process Framework Process Element: 
 Goal is stated. 
 Inputs may be defined. 
 Outputs may be defined.  
 Resources consumed may be defined.   
 Activities may be specified within description 
 Value should be stated. 
 Effect on organizational use may be stated 
 CRUD analysis may be available 


 
Principle Business Process Framework - 04 
(Best Practice): a Business Process Framework Process Element has a goal, an implied 
purpose or value proposition, inputs, outputs. It consists of activities/tasks and uses 
resources. It may have a CRUD and a RACI model. 
2.6 Decomposition 
Definition: Decomposition 
Decomposition is the breaking-down of a process into simpler activities. 
The Business Process Framework is a decomposition model from a notional Level 0 through to 
Level 4, and beyond (some Level 5 process elements are now defined and are being 
incorporated). Additionally, many individual users are developing lower-level decompositions 
that extend the Business Process Framework beyond the industry-agreed level (and in due 
course these may feedback to extend the level of industry agreement). In order to keep the 
Business Process Framework to a level which is generally useful it is not intended to decompose 
the Business Process Framework (i.e., as managed through the TM Forum) indefinitely. It is 
asserted that the further a decomposition is taken, the more difficult it is to prove the 
uniqueness of lower level processes. However, the level at which it becomes unproductive to 
extend further is not yet clear, and so decomposition continues to proceed in line with the 
industry’s priorities and available effort. 
 
Note:  
The relationship and mapping of these Business Process Framework Levels to an organization’s 
own processes and procedures is addressed in a later section “Organizational Context for the 
Business Process Framework”. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 05 
The Business Process Framework is decomposed from notional Level 0 to more granular 
levels – Levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 (and some of levels 5 and 6) are addressed so far. An agreed 
endpoint (i.e., a level below which decomposition does not proceed) is not yet defined. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 06 
It is not the purpose of the Business Process Framework to address the detailed 
processes and procedures of an enterprise. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 07 


represent particular priorities have been decomposed further into level 4 and below). 
 
 


2.7 Traceability 
Because the Business Process Framework is a decomposition model, the lower levels of the 
decomposition can be traced back to the higher levels. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 08 
The goals, inputs, outputs, and activities of decomposed Process Elements at a lower 
level are consistent with the higher-level Process Element. In particular, the input of the 
first lower level Process Element is the same as the input of the higher level Process 
Element; the output from the last lower level Process Element is the same as the output 
of the higher level Process Element; the detailed goals of the lower level Process 
Elements taken together should match the goal of the higher level Process Element; the 
activities of the lower level Process Elements taken together should match the activity of 
the higher level Process Element. 
2.8 Process dependency through information 
Business processes do not exist in isolation. Processes require information from other 
processes, and they in turn provide information to other processes. Dependencies (or 
associations) between processes occur when an activity requires information from another 
activity. Process dependencies are related to the entities and attributes required by the 
business area. The importance of analyzing and modeling dependencies is to provide further 
understanding of the interaction between processes and data. 
Note:  
An exercise has been underway for several years to map the Information Framework (SID) ABEs 
(Aggregate Business Entities) which are associated with Business Process Framework Process 
Elements. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 09 
(Best Practice): each Business Process Framework Process Element should identify its 
associated Information Framework ABEs. 
2.9 Grouping / organization within the Business Process Framework 
The Business Process Framework is a classification or taxonomy of Process Elements. At Level 
0 the elements are classified into S2R (Strategy to Operations) and Operations. Lower Levels 
are formed by decomposition with each Process Element occurring once only. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 10 


there is no replication. 
2.10 Flows 
Amongst the various flows that are characteristic in most organizations, there are three that 
are fundamental in the context of the Business Process Framework, namely the information 
flow, the material flow and the control flow. 
 The information flow concerns the flow of data or information, e.g., the 
information on an order as it is progressed; these can also be message flows.  
 The material flow concerns the actual physical items e.g., the items which 
constitute the order.  
 The control flow (or workflow) defines the logic of business processes i.e., the 
enterprise behavior in terms of a sequence or order in which enterprise activities 
must be performed to achieve business objectives.  
The definition of the Business Process Framework Process Elements themselves does not 
address these types of flow. However, the Business Process Framework does include a couple 
of Addenda: E and F; sample process flows and depictions of process interaction in swim lanes. 
These are examples of control flow. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 11 
Process flow examples in Business Process Framework are control flows, defining the 
sequence in which activities are performed. 
Note:  
Traceability also applies to swim lanes in Business Process Framework process flows. (See 
Principle Business Process Framework - 08) 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 12 
The swim lanes in a process flow are consistent within themselves and with 
respect to lower level decompositions. 
2.11 Dynamic aspects of Process Modeling 
The Business Process Framework Process Elements and example process flows are a process view 
of the enterprise behavior, based on sequences of activity. However, there are also dynamic 
aspects pertaining to the processes and their interaction. These are considered below. 
 
 Temporal aspects 


frequencies and possible delays between process steps. Process step durations 
(minimum, maximum, average durations) can also be indicated 
 Co-operative activities  
In practice, it is common that two or more activities of two different processes must 
work co-operatively, e.g., to exchange messages or objects. Methods include message 
passing and patterns. 
 Process communication 
In the case where processes must communicate, this means that some activities of 
one process must interact with activities of other processes. The previous mechanisms 
for co-operative activities can be used. 
 Process synchronization 
Process synchronization can happen in three different forms: (1) synchronization by 
events, (2) synchronization by messages and (3) synchronization by object flows.  
 Exception handling mechanisms 
Process models often only model the ideal structure of a business process. Real-world 
situations mostly consist of dealing with exceptions. Exceptions can either be 
predictable or unpredictable.  
 
Principle Business Process Framework.13 
Business Process Framework models success scenarios (sunny days). Error conditions 
are not in scope. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework.14 
Dynamic aspects of process modelling (e.g., workflow diagramming and sequential 
flows) are outside the scope of the Business Process Framework. 
2.12 Naming conventions 
The preferred convention for naming Level 3 Process Elements is <Verb Noun> e.g., “Configure 
& Activate Resource”, “Determine pre-order feasibility”, “Close Problem”. This is also the 
preferred convention for naming Process Elements at lower levels of decomposition (i.e., Level 
4 and below)  
The preferred convention for naming events is <Noun Verb> e.g., “Work Orders Executed”, 
“Resource Allocation & Configuration Done”. 
Note: Level 1 and Level 2 Process Names have not in the past used the convention above. 
Renaming existing Level 1 and Level 2 process elements is seen as unnecessarily disruptive and 
so the existing form (typically, <Noun> e.g., “Party Relationship Development & Retirement”, 
“Order Handling”) has been retained. New or modified process elements at Level 1 and/or 
Level 2 should continue to use this existing convention, so that there is consistency in the 
naming within a Level  


Principle Business Process Framework - 15 
Terminology and naming conventions are <Noun Verb> for Level 1 & 2 Process Names, 
<Verb Noun> for Level 3 Process Names, <Noun Verb> for events 
2.13  Layer References and Responsibilities 
A layered approach to the handling of responsibilities and information is taken in the Business 
Process Framework. Responsibility for association / translation between layers is generally 
positioned at the lower layer. For example, the Customer layer in the Operations area manages 
Customer Problems and the Service layer in the Operations area manages the Service Problems 
that may be associated, but it is the responsibility of the processes in the Service domain to 
map between these Service Problems. 
Thus, the Customer domain in the Operations area provides the Customer Problem (or some 
appropriate information from this) to the Service domain, which must then associate the one 
(or more) Service Problems that derive from this Customer Problem. Any ongoing interaction 
between Customer and Service layers is therefore in terms of Customer Problems (or 
information based on these) and not Service Problems, which are managed wholly within the 
Service layer. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 16 
Responsibility for association / translation between layers is generally positioned at the 
lower layer. 
2.14 Data Responsibility 
The process, which is managing data creation, update etc. has a prime responsibility for 
ensuring that the results of data which it is manipulating via the process are appropriately 
stored. 
 
Principle Business Process Framework - 17 
A process has prime responsibility for ensuring that the results of data manipulation are 
stored appropriately. 
 
 


3. Process Patterns 
3.1 Introduction 
In this section are presented examples of decomposition patterns in the Business Process 
Framework. These patterns serve as templates for process modeling in the particular process 
area. Patterns are identified at Level 3 for: 
 Problem Reports and their resolution 
 Strategic view and Business Plan 
 Order Lifecycle 
 Product Lifecycle 
Note: 
All Patterns should have associated Use Cases. Use Cases will be added in a later version of the 
document. 
3.2 Level 3 patterns 
Example 1 – Problem Reports and their resolution 
Applicable to ASSURANCE: Customer Problem Handling / Service Problem Management / 
Resource Trouble Management. 
This pattern consists of 4 process steps and 2 continuous processes. The process steps are: 
 “Create”. e.g., Problem Report, Trouble Report, Resource Trouble. 
 “Analyze”. Diagnose root cause. 
 “Fix”. Correct & Recover through recovery activities. 
 “Close”. Problem resolved, close report.  
With 2 processes running continuously: 
 “Track & Manage recovery activities” 
 “Report” 
Pre-condition / Inputs to this pattern are: a reported problem or an alarm or event at resource 
or service level. 
Post-condition / Output is: resolved problem, restoration of normal operation. 
Associated Use Case: 
Example 2 – Strategic view and Business Plan 
Applicable to Strategy Management: Service Strategy & Planning / Resource Strategy & 
Planning / Party Strategy & Planning 


 “Research”. Research & analyses, including management of research gathering. 
 “Strategy”. Formulate strategy and business goals 
 “Business Plans” 
 “Operational support.” 
 “Partnership.” (Null step for Supply Chain) 
 “Commit.” Gain Enterprise commitment. 
 
Pre-condition / Inputs to this pattern are research, forecasts 
Post-condition / Outputs are committed business plans and strategy. 
Associated Use Case: 
Example 3 – Order Lifecycle 
Customer Orders, Service Orders and Resource Orders through to Closure. “Track and Manage” 
and “Reporting” run continuously. 
Associated Use Case: 
Example 4 – Product Lifecycle 
From Research and New Product Development through In Service to Retirement. 
Associated Use Case: 
3.3 Level 4 Patterns 
Later issues of the document will show how the Pattern approach can be extended to Level 4. 
Note that these are guidelines, they do not prescribe or mandate Level 4. 
 


4. Organizational Context for the Business Process 
Framework 
4.1 Introduction 
This section sets out the enterprise context for process modeling, and the ways in which the 
Business Process Framework is applied. This section is not a guide on how to do process 
modeling in an organization, rather it sets out a generic framework for the various types of 
process (including manual human procedures) within a typical enterprise and shows how the 
Business Process Framework can be related to those organizational processes. 
4.2 Use of the Business Process Framework within an organization 
The use of the Business Process Framework by organizations involves the extension and 
refinement of the Business Process Framework to meet the specific business, operational, 
system and deployment needs of the organization. 
This section is based on the following view of how processes are developed and modeled within 
organizations, and the relationship of the process models to organization structures and 
systems developments. 
 


 
Figure 4-1 - Process Hierarchy 
PLEASE NOTE: As of release 14.5 of Frameworx it is acceptable for a core process to decompose 
to other core process. Thus, multi-level core processes are being added to the Business Process 
Framework.  
The best to way to structure a large amount of content and detail, while still allowing the 
higher-level views to present a summary view, is to structure the information in multiple Levels, 
where each Level is decomposed into greater detail at the next lower Level. This is Hierarchical 
Decomposition. 
By having the Business Process Framework structured into multiple Levels it enables users of 
the framework to align their enterprise framework or their process implementations with the 
Business Process Framework at different levels e.g., Align at Level 1 and 2 or align at Level 1, 2 
and 3. 
To summarize how levels are used in the Business Process Framework. 
 
Level 0 The whole Enterprise view (The entire Business Process Framework) as seen with its 
Process Areas and Domains altogether 
Level 1 Domains (horizontal) represent a Level 1 view along with the seven Context Verticals 
(previously referred to as Vertical Process Groupings). 
Level 2 All the Process Elements (aka Core Processes, e.g., Order Handling) which populate 
horizonal domains across the eTOM are Level 2. 


be Core Processes themselves or Tasks. 
Level 4 Process Elements which decompose from level-3 process elements are level-4; these 
can also be Core Processes themselves, or Tasks. 
Level 5 Process Elements which decompose from level-4 process elements are Level 5; these 
could also be Core Processes (exceptions) or Tasks. 
Level 6 Process elements are rarely decomposed in the eTOM into level 6 elements, but a few 
examples of these exist in the Framework. 
Level 7 Process elements are rarely decomposed in the eTOM into level 7 elements, but a few 
examples of these may exist in the Framework. 
4.3 The Business Process Framework and the Process Hierarchy 
The TM Forum Business Process Framework in its analysis has addressed the concerns shown 
in Level 0 through to Level 4, and now it is moving to address Level 5 and beyond in selected 
areas. 
However, the concerns for documenting lower levels in the Business Process Framework need 
to be addressed by an enterprise itself in implementing concrete detailed processes, roles and 
transactions.  
For such extensions to the Framework by an enterprise, the following section provides 
guidance on how an enterprise should execute these analysis steps. The benefit of these 
guidelines is that different enterprises will use a similar analysis approach to apply the Business 
Process Framework to their own organization. 


5. Guidance for extending and using the Business 
Process Framework 
Because of the changes in domains and additional structural changes to the Business Process 
Framework, significant amendments to diagrams and text has commenced 
5.1 Process Hierarchy: Decomposition Principles 
Traditionally Level 0 elements in the Business Process Framework (eTOM) have been known as 
PAs (Process Areas) there were three PAs in the eTOM until version 14.5: SIP (Strategy, 
Infrastructure & Product), Ops (Operations) and EM (Enterprise Management). Process Areas 
as such, are not (directly) aligned with business objectives, value streams or balance scorecards; 
Process Areas represent a partitioning or highest-level classification of processes of the 
enterprise. 
Currently there are two Process Areas left in the eTOM, these are: S2R (Strategy to Readiness) 
and Operations. Since version 14.5 the EM (Enterprise Management) Process Area has become 
the seventh horizontal domain in the framework and has been renamed “Enterprise” instead 
of “Enterprise Management”; the ‘Common’ transversal domain has been removed from the 
framework and its constituents refactored and distributed .across various horizontal domains 
as appropriate. 
In the past, Process Groupings represented by the 8 former horizontal domains and the 7 
verticals (known also as lifecycles in earlier times) were a way of decomposing and structuring 
(Level 0) Process Areas into the next level of detail (Level 1s for the horizontal process 
groupings), these are currently seven single horizontal (Level-1) process groupings and one 
(Level-1) vertical; these are all better known as domains: 1) Market & Sales, 2) Customer, 3) 
Product, 4) Service, 5) Resource, 6) Business Partner, 7) Enterprise. 
Core processes can be multi-level, typically they are Level 2 but there can be Level 3 core 
processes (although less common) and even Level 4 core processes. Core processes break 
down into Tasks. 
Level 3s, Level 4s, Level 5s, Level 6s, etc. are typically known as Tasks in the eTOM, although 
some process models e.g., APQC define a different way of decomposition in which Level 1 
(Categories) decompose into Level 2 (process groupings) which decompose into Level 3 
(processes) which themselves decompose into Level 4 (activities) which decompose into Level 
5 (tasks), but that is a different perspective. In fact, there are hundreds of different process 
models across all industry sectors and enterprises, some are standard, some are proprietary, 
and their structure can vary significantly, but the Business Process Framework (eTOM) provides 
a good balance in terms of structure and decomposition, due to its level of maturity, (telecoms) 
industry adoption and popularity, it is now being positioned more and more to be relevant to 
the full spectrum of the service provider industry, well beyond telecoms. 
 


6. Decomposition Guidelines 
Before providing a set of decomposition guidelines the properties of a process are provided.  Each 
framework process may have one or more of these properties.  As enterprise specific extensions are 
made to the framework, these properties should become part of the overall specification of the added 
processes. 
A process specification consists of: 
• 
A stated goal that the process achieves 
in terms of a purpose or result from applying the process 
• 
Inputs that may be defined 
• 
Outputs that may be defined 
Note that inputs transform to outputs through the process 
functionality/behavior  
• 
Resources consumed that may be defined 
Note for the Business Process Framework, resources may be defined 
through linkages with the Information Framework 
• 
Activities/Tasks into which the process decomposes that may be defined 
These may be embedded in the process description 
• 
A stated or implied value/benefit within the business 
May be related to how the process is used within a particular enterprise 
• 
Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) analysis that may be available 
This can link with the Information Framework 
• 
Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI) analysis that may be 
available 
Typically, this is related to how processes are mapped into organizations 
• 
Key Performance / Quality Indicators (KPIs/KQIs) 
 
These characteristics apply to all levels including extensions and should be included in the 
definition/description of the process.   
A process transforms inputs into outputs. The activities into which it decomposes are 
performed in some order.  The value is created for the customer. The customer may be internal 
or external. 


6.1 Consistency of Inputs and Outputs 
The goals, inputs, outputs, and activities of a decomposed process at a lower level are 
consistent and should match those of the higher-level process, specifically: 
• 
The goals, scope and content of the lower level processes taken together should 
match those of the higher-level process 
• 
Each input of the higher-level process is the same as an input of a lower level 
process 
• 
Each output of the higher-level process is the same as an output of a lower level 
process 
• 
The activities/behavior of the lower level processes taken together should 
match that of the higher-level process 
This ensures the consistency between process extensions to the framework and its further 
decomposition.  “First” and “last” mean the first and last in a sequence of process execution.  
The Problem Handling example previously described illustrates this. 
Customer Problem is input to the L3 process Isolate Customer Problem.  It is also input to the 
first L4 process, Verify Proper Product Use, into which Isolate Customer Problem decomposes.  
The Root Cause of the Customer Problem is output from the last L4 process, Provide Problem 
Analysis Completion Notification, it is also output from Isolate Customer Problem.  Note that 
this does not imply that these are the only inputs and outputs of the Isolate Customer Problem 
process or the processes into which it decomposes.  This is particularly true when dealing with 
higher level processes, such as L2 processes.

6.2 Additional Decomposition Guidelines 
The Business Process Framework represents a non-redundant decomposition; therefore, a 
process is not duplicated within the framework. 
Two different conventions are used for naming Business Process Framework processes.  Nouns, 
often nouns and/or gerunds (a noun form of a verb), such as Fulfilment, Billing and Revenue 
Management, Customer Problem Handling are used for L1 and L2 processes.  This convention 
indicates a higher-level process that is a combination of tasks (L3). The <verb noun> convention 
are used for processes that represent more discrete processes, such as tasks (L3, L4, L5, etc). 
Note that L3, L4, L5 refer to the levels within a process hierarchy and that there may be multiple 
levels of Business Process Framework process that represent a given process hierarchy level. A 
bit confusing, but the focus of the Business Process Framework process must be considered 
when classifying a Business Process Framework process within the levels of a process hierarchy. 
Association/translation between process layers, horizontal Business Process Framework 
processes, is the responsibility of the lower layer.  For example, the interaction from 
Customer Problem Handling to Service Problem Management is expressed in terms a 
Customer Problem Report. It is the responsibility of Service Problem Management, not 
Customer Problem Handling, to create the Service Problem Report(s) and associate the 
Report(s) to the Customer Problem Report. This in part helps ensure that the lifecycle of 
the entity is managed by a single L2 process and is not split among more than one L2 
process. 
The process which manages data creation, update, and so forth has a prime responsibility for 
ensuring that the results of data which it is manipulating via the process are appropriately 
stored. 
When decomposing a process to L3 or to L4, and sometimes below L4, it is helpful to think of 
the next level of decomposition in terms which represents “life cycle” decomposition.  Life cycle 
decomposition is a technique to use when identifying processes that move an object/entity 
through its life of interest to the business.  L3/L4 processes, each of which represents the task 
level within the process decomposition, naturally focus on a single state in the life cycle of an 
object/entity.  Typical processes in the decomposition perform “Plan”, “Acquire”, “Use”, 
“Dispose” tasks.  The set of tasks is typically made up of those that plan to use an object/entity, 
which acquires an object/entity, which uses an object/entity, and which disposes of an entity.  
Note that life cycle decomposition is just one of the many techniques described here which 
may be used to identify lower level process elements. 
The lifecycle often depends on the category of entity.  Plan, Acquire, Use, Dispose processes 
may take on names specific to the type of entities/objects upon which they act.  Shown below 
are some examples of the names associated with different categories of entities. 


cycle related processes: 
• 
Gather/analyze 
• 
Develop 
• 
Deploy 
• 
Assess 
• 
Retire. 
Intangible oriented entities, such as strategies and plans may have the following life cycle 
related processes: 
• 
Research/analyze 
• 
Formulate/prepare 
• 
Approve/commit 
• 
Assess 
• 
Retire. 
Activity oriented entities, such as orders and problems may have the following life cycle related 
processes: 
• 
Issue/Create 
• 
Analyze/diagnose 
• 
Fix, monitor, correct 
• 
Close. 
Note that the actual decomposition may only consist of a subset of these types of activities.  
There are many examples of this type of decomposition in the framework. 
Note also that while products and services are intangible entities, they are typically realized by 
in part some type of physical (tangible) resource. The first set of sample process names 
represents processes that appear in the Lifecycle Management L1 vertical context; the second 
set represents processes that appear in the Strategy Management vertical.  The third set 
represents processes associated with activity-oriented entities that span Fulfilment and 
Assurance. 
For example, the decomposition of the L2 Problem Handling includes Create Customer 
Problem Report (Acquire), Correct & Recover Customer Problem (Use), and Close Customer 
Problem Report (Dispose) represents processes that appear in the Assurance L1 context 
vertical. In this example there is no equivalent for the Plan process. 
Below L2, beware “/”, “&”, and their variants in process names, which typically means process 
should be split.  Although the Business Process Framework does not always follow the last 
guideline, processes whose names imply more than one process, such as Implement, 
Configure, and Activate Service could be split into three processes at the next level of 


to manage the number of processes that appear at that level. 
6.3 Information Framework Related Guidelines 
These guidelines were developed as the Business Process Framework/Information Framework 
mapping team defined actions taken by processes on SID entities and as the team began to 
identify L4 processes.  
An Aggregate Business Entity (ABE) is a group of closely related (cohesive) entities, such as 
Customer Problem Report and Service Order. A L2 process manages the life of a small number 
of ABEs.  For example, Service Configuration & Activation manages the life of the Service Order 
and Service ABEs as defined by the published Business Process Framework/Information 
Framework L2 to ABE mappings.  Customer Problem Handling manages the life cycle of a 
Customer Problem Report.  The L3 processes focus on states within the life cycle of an ABE.  For 
example, Issue Service Order focuses on the creation state; Close Service Order focuses on the 
completion state.  A similar relationship exists for the L3 processes that define Problem 
Handling.  Lower level processes deal with managing the states of the entities associated with 
the L3 processes and no others. 
A process in one domain, such as Customer, Product, Service, does not create instances of 
entities in another domain. This guideline follows on from the layer’s guideline.  For example, 
Problem Handling does not create instances of Service Problem Report.  Similarly, Order 
Handling does not create instances of Service Orders.  The two L2 processes reside within the 
Customer and the Product domains (L1 horizontal process groupings) domains, while Service 
Problem Report and Service Order are Service domain entities. 
6.4 Semantic Analysis 
In linguistics, semantic analysis is the process of relating syntactic structures, from the levels of 
phrases, clauses, sentences and paragraphs to the level of the writing as a whole, to their 
language-independent meanings, removing features specific to particular linguistic and cultural 
contexts, to the extent that such a project is possible. The elements of idiom (a fixed distinctive 
expression whose meaning cannot be deduced from the combined meanings of its actual 
words) and figurative speech, being cultural, must also be converted into relatively invariant 
meanings. 
Semantic analysis is much like sentence diagramming that we all learned at an early age.  The 
descriptions of L3 processes can be used and analyzed to begin identifying L4 processes. 
This is accomplished by performing semantic analysis on the description of a process: 
• 
Look for nouns (entities) upon which actions are performed 
• 
Look for verbs that act on nouns (entities) 
• 
Look for phrases that imply actions on nouns (entities). 


interact with the processes being identified. 
Semantic Analysis should be considered as just another of the many techniques described in 
this section that can be used to decompose processes.  The techniques can be viewed as 
supplemental to the techniques currently in use within an organization.  Often, Semantic 
Analysis is carried out iteratively with other techniques and may result in updating the 
description of a process to which Semantic Analysis was originally applied.  The goal would be 
that the final decomposition(s) are consistent with the parent process description(s) from a 
Semantic Analysis viewpoint. 
For simple L3 processes whose description is brief, such as Close Service Performance 
Degradation Report and Audit Data Collection & Distribution, decomposition to L4 may not be 
possible.  Their descriptions are included here to illustrate this point. 
Close Service Performance Degradation Report - The objective of the Close Service 
Performance Degradation Report processes is to close a service performance degradation 
report when the service performance has been resolved. These processes monitor the status 
of all open service performance degradation reports and recognize that a service performance 
degradation report is ready to be closed when the status is changed to clear.  
Audit Data Collection & Distribution - The Audit Data Collection & Distribution processes are 
responsible for auditing the management information & data collection activities in order to 
identify possible anomalies such as loss of management information and/or data in the 
different collection, processing and distribution steps. 
Decomposing from L3 Description Example 1 – Isolate Customer Problem 
Isolate Customer Problem is the L3 process being decomposed. 
The purpose of the Isolate Customer Problem processes is to identify the root cause of the 
customer problem. The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to: 
Verifying Configuration; and 
Performing specific customer problem diagnostics based on the customer provided 
information to determine whether the root cause of the customer problem is linked to the 
underlying services. 
The Isolate Customer Problem processes will make the results of the root cause analysis 
available to other processes. The Isolate Customer Problem processes will update open 
customer problem report, as required during the assessment, and when the root cause has 
been identified.  The Isolate Customer Problem processes will notify the Track & Manage 
Customer Problem processes when the analysis is complete. 
The highlighted text represents the candidate L4 processes using the semantic analysis 
guidelines described previously in this section.  Not all of the descriptions resulted in candidate 
L4 processes.  Some were used as part of the description of the L4s or represent the initiation 
of flows to other processes.  For example, the notification to Track & Manage Customer 
Problem is defined using a flow to that process; updating the open Customer Problem Report 
is also accomplished by initiating a flow to Track & Manage Customer Problem. 
Note that all the nouns (entities) deal with the Customer Problem ABE and its entities, such as 
Root Cause. 


diagram for Isolate Customer Problem.  Some of the process’s names represent interpretations 
that were made based on the analysis of the Isolate Customer Problem description.  All of the 
L4 processes deal with the “isolate” state of the Customer Problem. 
The Provide Problem Analysis Completion Notification implies a flow to another process, such 
as Track & Manage Customer Problem L3 or an L4 process within the Track & Manage 
decomposition. 
 
Figure 6-2 - Isolate Customer Problem Decomposition 
 
Below are examples of L4 process descriptions.  The descriptions of the L4 processes were 
based on the description of the L3 process.  These L4 processes represent the lowest level to 
which the current Isolate Customer Problem can be decomposed.  Later in this chapter we will 
discuss how processes can be extended using this same technique of starting with an extended 
description of a process.  Other guidelines for extending the framework will also be provided. 
• 
Verify Product Configuration 
This process verifies whether the customer is using the purchased product offering 
correctly. 
• 
Perform Specific Customer Problem Diagnostics 
This process performs diagnostics based on the customer provided information to 
determine whether the root cause of the customer problem is linked to the underlying 
services. 
• 
Perform Specific Customer Problem Tests 
This process runs tests against specific services. 
• 
Notify T&M Root Cause Customer Problem 
This process notifies the Track & Manage Customer Problem processes when the analysis 
is complete. 
• 
Categorize Customer Problem 
This process is responsible for categorizing the customer problem according to the type of 
the problem, impact, and standardized criteria at CRM level. Moreover, this activity will be 


Customer Problem" process. Analyze customer problems, filter out irrelevant and false 
problems. Determine the problem severity based on its impact and set the appropriate 
priority. 
• 
Identify Root Cause / Check for Workarounds 
Verify the configuration of the customer’s product. Look for the root cause of the customer 
problem. If the cause is determined, recommend a workaround or a temporary fix for the 
problem. 
• 
Obtain permanent fix or workarounds 
Check for permanent fixes for the customer and if not available look for possible 
workarounds as remedy for the problem. 
• 
Create customer problem restoration plan 
The primary aim is to put a plan to restore the ‘normal service’ to the customer as quickly 
as possible. That should include anything that is needed to allow the customer to return 
to the normal working, in order to minimize business impact 
• 
Create Known record 
The record includes the details of the problem and the symptoms that occurred, together 
with precise details of any workaround or fix that can be taken to restore the service 
and/or resolve the problem. 
 
 


This example illustrates the current L3/L4 process decomposition work being undertaken by 
the Business Process Framework/Information Framework mapping team. This example 
illustrates the work accomplished for the L3 processes for the L2 Customer Problem Handling 
process. Inputs and outputs were derived from the descriptions and implied actions on entities 
contained in the descriptions of the L3 processes.  These, along with semantic analysis, 
discussed earlier in this chapter, were used to deduce the candidate L4 processes that will make 
their way into the framework. 
The Inputs and outputs can be used to construct/confirm L3 and L4 process flow diagrams.  This 
process shows the work done that resulted in the Problem Handling decompositions.

7. Audit Checklist 
This section contains a checklist of the Business Process Framework principles for its use and application within 
an organization. 
 
Principle 
 
Business Process 
Framework - 01 
The Business Process Framework is an activity-based process 
decomposition model 
Business Process 
Framework - 02 
The Business Process Framework Process Elements are 
comprehensive for a Service Provider 
Business Process 
Framework - 03 
A Business Process Framework Process Element is a succession of 
activities with a control flow 
Business Process 
Framework - 04 
(Best Practice): A Business Process Framework Process Element has 
a goal, value proposition, inputs, outputs. It consists of activities 
and uses resources. It has a CRUD and RACI model. 
Business Process 
Framework - 05 
The Business Process Framework is decomposed from notional 
Level 0 to more granular levels – Levels 1, 2 and 3 (and some of 
level 4) are addressed so far. An agreed endpoint (i.e., a level 
below which decomposition does not proceed) is not yet defined. 
Business Process 
Framework - 06 
It is not the purpose of the Business Process Framework to address 
the detailed processes and procedures of an enterprise 
Business Process 
Framework - 07 
The Enterprise Domain is generally decomposed to Level 3 only 
(but specific areas that represent particular priorities have been 
decomposed further). 
Business Process 
Framework - 08 
The goals, inputs, outputs, and activities of decomposed Process 
Elements at a lower level are consistent with the higher-level 
Process Element. In particular, the input of the first lower level 
Process Element is the same as the input of the higher level 
Process Element; the output from the last lower level Process 
Element is the same as the output of the higher level Process 
Element; the goals of the lower level Process Elements taken 
together should match the goal of the higher level Process 
Element; the activities of the lower level Process Elements taken 
together should match the activity of the higher level Process 
Element. 
 
 
 


Principle 
 
Business Process 
Framework - 09 
(Best Practice): each Business Process Framework Process Element 
should identify its associated Information Framework ABEs  
Business Process 
Framework - 10 
A particular Process Element will occur only once in the Business 
Process Framework; there is no replication 
Business Process 
Framework - 11 
Process flows in the Business Process Framework are control flows, 
defining the sequence order in which activities are performed. 
Business Process 
Framework - 12 
The swim lanes in a process flow are consistent within themselves 
and with respect to lower level decompositions. 
Business Process 
Framework - 13 
The Business Process Framework models success scenarios. Error 
conditions are not in scope. 
Business Process 
Framework - 14 
Dynamic aspects of process modelling are outside the scope of the 
Business Process Framework. 
Business Process 
Framework - 15 
Terminology and naming conventions are <Noun> for Level 1 & 2 
Process Names, <Verb Noun> of Level 3 Process Names, <Noun 
Verb> for events. 
Business Process 
Framework - 16 
Responsibility for association / translation between layers is 
generally positioned at the lower layer. 
Business Process 
Framework - 17 
A process has prime responsibility for ensuring that the results of 
data manipulation are sowed appropriately.
