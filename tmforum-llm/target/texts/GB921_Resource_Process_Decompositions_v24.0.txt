 General Information 
This document contains the text of the Business Process Framework for context and more information please refer to âGB991 Core Frameworks Concepts
and Principlesâ guidebook. 
 Preface 
eTOM Business Process Framework 
The eTOM or Business Process Framework is a reference framework for categorizing all the business activities used by an enterprise involved in delivering
on-line Information, Communications and Entertainment services. This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process 
components or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to
show organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. 
The eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and
the starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional 
application for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an 
industry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with 
other enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required 
functions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. 
 
 Introduction 
This document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out 
this domain. 
The focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke
Product, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes. 


The decomposition starts with a top level process which is a Core Process that details the activity that takes place and describes all subsequent activities 
that occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then
describing a unique path of action and further detail the specific process. This is then repeated to lower level of granularly of up to seven levees.  
At the start of each Level 2 process a diagram details all of its sub processes is placed. This diagram showers Level 3 process and the level 4 process 
below them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition
include another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   
Process Associations and IDs 
To aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. 
Processes have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: 
.b.x.c.d.e where  
 
b: 
This digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses 
to  
extended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   
x: 
Digit representing Domain  
c: 
Digit representing Level 2 process 
d: 
Digit representing Level 4 process 
e: 
Digit representing Level 5 process 
The unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. 


Typographic Conventions 
 
Â·  A Business Process is represented by a decorator in form of an arrow located to the top right. A red dot decorator with the initial TMF indicates that 
this is a TM Forum Business Process. The color yellow background hints to the business  layer.

Develop resource strategies, policies and plans for the enterprise, based on the long-term business, market, product and service directions of the 
enterprise. 
Extended Description: 
Resource Strategy Management processes develop resource strategies, policies and plans for the enterprise, based on the long-term business, market, 
product and service directions of the enterprise  These processes understand the capabilities of the existing enterprise infrastructure, capture the 
requirements on the infrastructure based on market, product and service strategies of the enterpriseâ, manage the capabilities of the suppliers and partners
to develop and deliver new resource capabilities, and define the way that new or enhanced infrastructure may be deployed.  
Research & analysis is performed to determine resource targets as well as strategies to reach the defined targets.  This research may be obtained from the
external market and resource suppliers and partners, or developed internally through research programs and activities, or leverage of other internal 
knowledge, such as marketing data.  A key input to the resource strategy arises from the enterpriseâs market, product portfolio and service strategy and 
forecasts. The latter may include AI based predictions towards resource requirements. A focus is placed on the expansion of the existing resource 
capabilities and the identification of new resource capabilities required.   
These processes deliver and develop annual and multi-year resource plans in support of services, products and offers that include volume forecasts, 
negotiation for required levels of resources, gaining resource development and management as well as supply chain commitment and executive approval 
for the plans. In addition, the processes may also develop more short-term resource plans in order to optimize near-term balance between supply and 
demand of resources. 
Forecasting of resource demand, and capturing of new opportunities, are both essential to ensure that the enterprise can construct and implement the 
resources necessary for the future needs of their customers and potential customers. 
These processes define the resource implementation standards sought, key new resource capabilities required, resource support levels and approaches 
required, resource design elements to be developed, as well as resource cost parameters and targets. These processes also define the policies relating to
technical resources and their implementation. 
This process was renamed in 24.0 Old Name was Resource Strategy & Planning

The objectives of these processes are to efficiently and effectively manage reported resource trouble, isolate the root cause and act to resolve the resource
trouble.  
 
Responsibilities of the Resource Trouble Management processes include, but are not limited to: 
 
â¢ Detecting, analyzing, managing and reporting on resource alarm event notifications;  
â¢ Initiating and managing resource trouble reports; 
â¢ Performing resource trouble localization analysis;  
â¢ Correcting and resolving resource trouble; 


â¢ Reporting progress on resource trouble reports to other processes; 
â¢ Assigning & tracking resource trouble testing and repair activities  
â¢ Managing resource trouble jeopardy conditions. 
 
On one hand, resource troubles may relate to Problems in the Service domain and therefore also potentially in the customer domain. On the other hand, 
they may relate to specific resource failures or performance degradations, which are caused by resource faults. 
As such, the Resource Trouble Management processes work with specific resource alarm event notifications received from Resource Data Collection & 
Distribution, specific resource performance notifications from Resource Performance Management, and potential specific resource trouble notifications from
Service Problem Management processes. 
 
Resource Trouble Management processes perform analysis, decide on the appropriate actions/responses and carry them out with the intent of restoring 
normal operation on specific resources.  
However these activities need to interact with the Service Problem Management processes, as the latter have a view on service impact.  Resource Trouble
Management processes are responsible for informing Service Problem Management of any potential service problems.  Where the original report arose as
a result of service problems, the Resource Trouble Management processes may be coordinated by Service Problem Management processes.

 Survey & Analyze Resource Trouble 
Process Identifier: 1.5.8.1 
Hierarchy Level: 3 
Brief Description: 
Monitor resource alarm event notifications and manage resource alarm event records in real-time.  Resource alarm event notifications include those alarms
related to security events. 
Extended Description: 
The objective of the Survey & Analyze Resource Trouble processes is to monitor resource alarm event notifications and manage resource alarm event 
records in real-time. 
 
Responsibilities of the Survey & Analyze Resource Trouble processes include, but are not limited to: 
â¢ Detecting and collecting resource alarm event notifications;  
â¢ Initiating and managing resource alarm event records; 
â¢ Performing resource alarm event notification localization analysis;  
â¢ Correlating and filtering resource alarm event records; 
â¢ Reporting resource alarm event record status changes to other processes 
â¢ Managing resource alarm event record jeopardy conditions. 
 


Resource alarm event notification analysis encompasses the identification of the resource alarm event in terms of reporting entity and nature of the 
resource alarm event. It will then analyze the resource alarm events based on a number of criteria and then suppress redundant, transient or implied 
resource alarm events by means of filtering and correlation. It includes the notification of new resource alarm event records, or status changes of previousl
reported resource alarm event records, as well as abatement messages when resource alarm event records have been cleared. 
 
The analysis will correlate resource alarm event notifications to planned outage notifications to remove false resource alarm event notifications arising as a
result of the planned outage activity. 
 
These processes may determine that a resource alarm event notification may represent a service impacting condition. In these circumstances this process
is responsible for indicating a potential service problem to the Service Problem Management processes. As a part of this indication this process is 
responsible for identifying the impacted service instances associated with the resource instances presenting alarm event notifications and passing this 
information to the Service Problem Management processes. 
 
Resource alarm event record correlation and filtering encompasses the correlation of redundant, transient or implied resource alarm event notifications with
a specific âroot causeâ resource alarm event notification and associated resource alarm event record. 
 
The Survey & Analyze Resource Trouble processes might trigger a well-defined action based on specific resource alarm event notification information as 
well as the non-arrival of resource alarm event notification information after a specific time interval has elapsed. 
 
These processes are also responsible for monitoring and triggering the appropriate action when a resource alarm event record is not cleared within a pre-
defined period of time.
