 Introduction
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Resource Pool management.
It includes the model definition as well as all available operations.


 Sample Use Cases
The following scenario is used in the further chapters to demonstrate the use of the API
model structure.
UC: PhoneNumber Pool Management
In this scenario, the CSP obtained a range of Phone Numbers from the regulatory agency.
The CSP splits that range into smaller parts, each dedicated to one of CSP’s partners. For
each partner, CSP creates a Resource Pool for Phone Numbers (attaching Phone Number
ResourceSpecification to the Pool), with the corresponding Capacity, and fills the respective
Phone Number Resources into the Pool by a Push task.
Before 
the 
CSP 
can 
create 
the 
individual 
Resource 
Pools, 
he 
sets 
up 
a
ResourcePoolSpecification; to be able to attach capacities, a CapacitySpecification is
needed.
A partner can then (via the Resource Reservation API, as part of the pre-order process)
request reservation of individual Phone Numbers.
Precondition:
• There is a ResourceSpecification in the Resource Catalog that defines how Resources
representing a Phone Number are structured.
• The partners exist as PartyRole with attached Organization (Party)
Customer
Partner
CSP
Resource
Reservation
Resource
Order
Resource
Inventory
Resource
Pool
create CapacitySpecification
create ResourcePoolSpecification
loop
[for each Partner]
create ResourcePool for Phone Numbers (Resources) and Partner
push Phone Numbers to ResourcePool (as ResourceCollection or as individual Resources)
pre-order access line with Phone Number
request reservation of Phone Number
check availabilty of Phone Number
available capacity
extract Phone Number from partner's Resource Pool
Phone Number (Resource)
create Resource Reservation
update status of Phone Number Resource to reserved
order
place order
create Resource Order
assign Phone Number to Customer,
set status to "active"
Note: The inclusion of Resource Reservation and Order in the diagram is out of scope of the
functionality of the Resource Pool, but shown here only for reasons of illustration.
Remark: Although CSP and/or Partner might not be persons, but e.g. automated


 
applications on CSP resp. Partenr side, they are shown as persons, to symbolize that from
the Enterprise’s perspective the occurrence of their requests is out of the Enterprise’s
control.
A Resource Pool represents a collection of Resources of some type, modelled by a
Resource Specification. The Pool can contain specific Capacities of such Resources, without
the need to instanciate the Resources. For example, a range of Phone Number can be
modeled as Capacity in a Pool with having to create individual Resources for the numbers.
The Pool can be filled by either pushing Resource instances into it, or by updating the Pool
with additional Capacities.
The Pool can be queried for a specific amount (capacityDemand) of Resources, and returns
possible options to fulfill the demand. The availabilty check only returns available capacities,
not any individual resources. This avoids that the Resources are used by some follow-up
process; the Pool would then loose control of whether the Resources are still available in the
Pool of have been used elsewhere.
To get individual Resources from the Pool, they can be extracted. Resources that are
extracted from the Pool may or may not be stored in the Resource inventory. How
instantiation of Resources is handled, and in particular if and by which IT component their ID
is generated, is out of scope of the management of the Resource Pool.


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.


 RESOURCE MODEL
Managed Entity and Task Resource Models
CapacitySpecification resource
Capacity is a specific amount of an entity measured in quantity and units of quantity over an
extended period. In essence, a CapacitySpecification defines the common attributes and
relationships of a set of related Capacities, while Capacity defines a specific instance that is
based on a particular CapacitySpecification.

capacityCharacteristicSpecificatio
n
A CharacteristicSpecification. This class defines a characteristic
specification.
description
A String. Description of this REST resource.


 
externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.
href
A String. Hyperlink reference.
id
A String. Unique identifier.
name
A String. Name given to this REST resource.
relatedCapacitySpecification
A CapacitySpecification. Capacity is a specific amount of an
entity measured in quantity and units of quantity over an
extended period. In essence, a CapacitySpecification defines the
common attributes and relationships of a set of related
Capacities, while Capacity defines a specific instance that is
based on a particular CapacitySpecification.

A CharacteristicValueSpecification. Specification of a value
(number or text or an object) that can be assigned to a
Characteristic. This is an abstract base class, the actual value is
in one of the strongly-typed subclasses :
BooleanArrayCharacteristicValueSpecification,

ResourcePoolSpecification resource
Defines the common characteristics of a specific kind of Resource Pools, including the types
of Capacities that can be handled by Pools of this type. Resource Pools are managed as
(Logical) Resources, and accordingly Resource Pool Specifications are managed the same
way as (Logical) Resource Specification, e.g. put into the Resource Catalog.

ResourcePool resource
Represents a set of Resource of a given type (represented by a ResourceSpecification),
without the need to instantiate all Resource entities, e.g. all phone numbers in a given range.
The amount of Resources in th pool is modelled as Capacity. The Pool can be querried for
some amount (Capacity) of availabile resources; actual Resource instances can be pushed
into the pool, and contained Resources can be extracted. The Pool itself is understood to be
a (Logical) Resource in itself, so it can be managed the same way as any other Resource,
e.g. put into the Resource inventory, and can be associated with some Party and located at
some Place.

The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the
figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub
class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId),
an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification
structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field
("resourceName" placeholder).

Updates partially a CapacitySpecification
PATCH /capacitySpecification/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a CapacitySpecification entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optional. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources


 
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

Updates partially a ResourcePoolSpecification
PATCH /resourcePoolSpecification/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a ResourcePoolSpecification entity. Support of
json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) 
is 
mandatory, 
support 
of 
json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optional. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Updates partially a ResourcePool
PATCH /resourcePool/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a ResourcePool entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7396) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optional. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
201

Design Guidelines.
