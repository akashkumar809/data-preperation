Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Shipping Order Management. Shipping Order is 
part of the Shipping set of APIs, beside the Shipment Management (TMF 711), Shipment Qualification (TMF 
712), Shipment Tracking (TMF 684). 
 
It includes the model definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are creating, updating and 
retrieving Shipping Orders.   
 
The Shipping Ordering API provides a standardized mechanism for placing a shipping order with all of the 
necessary order parameters. The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with logistic systems in 
a consistent manner. A shipping order is created based on a product order that is managed via Product Order 
Management. The shipping order captures all the details required to ship a product or a set of products that 
have been purchased via the product order to the customer. It includes beside the details related to the 
products identified by the product offers, the actors involved in the process (sender, recipient), locations (from, 
to), shipping details, instructions and characteristics at the shipping order level or fine grained at every item 
from the shipping order.  
 
The shipping order references the product order (product order items, product order item offer) and identifies 
any specific requests made by the customer in regards to the shipping. 
 
A Shipping Order is a document used by a business to specify what items are to be transferred by a logisitic 
partner from a storage location or warehouse to a party location. When goods are sent to the customers, 
shipment information can be provided to them so they can be aware of when things were shipped and when 
they will arrive. The service provider creates a Shipping Order which can be sent to a Logistic Partner to 
manage the physical shipment. The Shipping Order can be split into one or more Shipments with associated 
Shipment Tracking to capture information about the current status of the shipment, the past checkpoints and 
the estimated arrival date. 
 
Shipping Order API manages shipping order resource:

The service provider creates a Shipping Order which can be sent to a Logistic Partner to manage the 
physical shipment(s). The Shipping Order can be split into one or more Shipments (Shipment 
Managment (TMF711)) with associated Shipment Tracking (via TMF 684) to capture information about 
the current status of the shipment, the past checkpoints and the estimated arrival date. 
• 
Main Shipping Order attributes are its identifier, state, items, shipping instructions, related parties 
involved (recipient, sender), source and destination place. 
• 
Main Shipping Order Items (aka shipping order lines) attributes are the ordered items and product 
characteristics with the related action to be performed (e.g. add or delete the products), state, location 
information for delivery.

Shipping Ordering API performs the following operations 
…on Shipping Order: 
• 
Retrieval of a shipping order or a collection of shipping orders depending on filter criteria 
• 
Partial update of a shipping order (including updating rules) 
• 
Creation of a shipping order (including default values and creation rules) 
• 
Notification of events on shipping order 
o Shipping Order creation 
o Shipping Order state change 
o Shipping Order value change used to notify that any data in an order has just changed 
o Shipping Order information required used to notify that some data in the order need to be filled / 
are missing 
 
The following assumptions were considered in the development of this document: 
• 
The Logistic Management system has access to additional systems to retrieve additional information 
required like product offerings, parties, places, etc.

SAMPLE USE CASES 
The main use case the shipping order is created as a result of a Product Order. 
1. Order Management System (OMS) sends a request to create a shipping order in the Partner Logistics 
System. The OMS will pass the information on the Product Order and the items and an indication on the 
shipments that will take place. 
2. The new Shipping Order is created in the Partner Logistics System. The Logistic Partner will receive the 
order items, check/update stock, organize items by pick list, pick & pack, select carriers (depending on the 
services from orders), etc. 
3. Part of the fulfillment the Logistic Partner, depending on warehouse stocks, customer preferences will 
create one or multiple shipments that can contain one or multiple items from the original Shipping Order. 
The Logistic Partner (+ customer preference) might create multiple shipments depending on the stock 
availability or might bundle and keep the order open until stock replenish. 
4. Each shipment will be updated by the carrier service with the delivery of good progress. Upon creation of 
each shipment, if the tracking information will be available from the carrier service the shipment will be 
updated to reflect it. 
5. Upon completion of all shipments, the Shipping Order will be updated. 
6. Upon successfully completing the shipping order, the Product Order will be updated.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base 
entities, for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account 
entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. 
The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be 
provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an PartyAccountRef object) to explicitly 
denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes 
the class type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of 
the referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in 
reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

Shipping Order resource 
A Shipping Order is a document used by a business to specify what items are to be transferred by a logistic partner 
from a storage location or warehouse to a party location. When goods are sent to the customers, shipment 
information can be provided to them so they can be aware of when things were shipped and when they will arrive. 
The service provider creates a Shipping Order which can be sent to a Logistic Partner to manage the physical 
shipment. The Shipping Order can be split into one or more Shipments with associated Shipment Tracking to 
capture information about the current status of the shipment, the past checkpoints and the estimated arrival date.

State 
Definition 
Acknowledged 
The Acknowledged state is where an shipping order has been received 
and has passed message and basic business validations. 
Rejected 
The Rejected state is where:  
• 
Invalid information is provided through the order request 
• 
The order request fails to meet business rules for ordering 
Same rules applied for order item. 
Pending 
The Pending state is used when an order/item is currently in a waiting 
stage for an action/activity to be completed before the order/item can 
progress further. In situations where Access Seeker action is required, an 
“information required” notification will be issued on transition into this 
state.  
A pending stage can lead into auto cancellation of an order/item, if no 
action is taken within the defined timeframes to be described under the 
Agreement. 
InProgress 
The In Progress state is where an order Item has an associated shipment 
associated successfully and product delivery has started. 
For the order at least one order item is inProgress 
Held 
The Held state is used when an order/item cannot be progressed due to 
an issue. SP has temporarily delayed completing an order/item to resolve 
an infrastructure shortfall to facilitate supply of order. Upon resolution of 
the issue, the order/item will continue to progress. 
Cancelled 
The Cancelled state is where an In-Flight Order/item has been 
successfully cancelled. 
Completed 
The Completed state is where an item has complete provision and the 
service is now active. 
For an order all order item are completed 
Failed 
Order item as not a successful delivery completion. The product is not 
delivered and the order item failed. 
All Order items have failed which results in the entire Order has Failed. 
Partial 
Some Order items have failed and some have succeeded so the entire 
Order is in a Partial state. This provides support for partial Failure of an 
Order. 
This state is not available at item level

Update shipping order 
  PUT /shippingOrder/{id} 
Description 
This operation updates a shipping order entity. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PUT operation. 
Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Patch shipping order 
  PATCH /shippingOrder/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a shipping order entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again.
