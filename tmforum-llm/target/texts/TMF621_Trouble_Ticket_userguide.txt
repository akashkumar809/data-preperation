 Introduction
The Trouble Ticket API provides a standardized client interface to Trouble Ticket
Management Systems for creating, tracking and managing trouble tickets as a result of an
issue or problem identified by a customer or another system. Examples of Trouble Ticket API
originators (clients) include CRM applications, network management or fault management
systems, or other Trouble Ticket management systems (e.g. B2B). The API supports the
ability to send requests to create a new trouble ticket specifying the nature and severity of
the trouble or issue as well as all necessary related information. The API also includes
mechanisms to search for and update existing trouble tickets. Notifications are defined to
provide information when a trouble ticket has been updated, including status changes. A
basic set of status of a trouble ticket has been specified (as an example) to handle trouble
ticket lifecycle management. Trouble Ticketing API manages trouble ticket resource:
• A trouble ticket represents a record, or an issue raised by requestor that need to be
solved, used for reporting and managing the resolution of problems, incidents or request
• Main trouble ticket attributes are its description, severity, type, related dates (creation,
expected resolution, resolution), status and related information (change reason and
change date), related parties (originator, owner, reviser, etc.), related entities (product,
product order, customer bill) and notes Trouble Ticket API performs the following
operations on trouble ticket:
• Retrieval of a trouble ticket or a collection of trouble ticket depending on filter criteria
• Partial update of a trouble ticket
• Creation of a trouble ticket Notification of events on trouble ticket:
◦Trouble ticket status change
◦Trouble ticket attribute value change
◦Trouble ticket resoled
◦Trouble ticket delete (typically restricted to admin role)
◦Trouble ticket created
◦Trouble ticket Information required Trouble Ticket API performs the following
operations on trouble ticket specification
• Retrieval of a trouble ticket specification or a collection of trouble ticket specification
depending on filter criteria
• Partial update of a trouble ticket specification
• Creation of a trouble ticket specification
• Notification of events on trouble ticket specification:
◦Trouble ticket specification status change
◦Trouble ticket specification attribute value change
◦Trouble ticket specification delete (typically restricted to admin role)
◦Trouble ticket specification created


 Sample Use Cases
Use Case 1: User Raise Issue With Bill
• The user checks his last bill and he is not convinced that the charged amount is
appropriate
• The user wants to dispute the bill and opens an issue (a commercial trouble ticket) to
initiate the claim
• The new issue is added to the list of issues already open by the user.
• After some time, the user checks the status of the complaint in the app to understand if it
has been resolved and the resolution details.
Trouble Ticket Life Cycle


 
Trouble Ticket Specification Life Cycle


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingTroubleTicket
and NetworkTroubleTicket inheriting properties from the abstract TroubleTicketcount entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of TroubleTicket instances some may be instances of
BillingTroubleTicket where other could be instances of NetworkTroubleTicket. The @type
gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes
that can be provided when this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an TroubleTicket
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingTroubleTicketRef or NetworkTroubleTickeRef, and not the class type of the referred
object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not
useful in reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.


 RESOURCE MODEL
Managed Entity and Task Resource Models
TroubleTicket resource
A trouble ticket is a record of an issue that is created, tracked, and managed by a trouble
ticket management system.
Resource model


 
Figure 1 - TroubleTicket


 
Figure 2 - Characteristic
Field descriptions
TroubleTicket fields
attachment
An AttachmentRefOrValue. File(s) attached to the trouble ticket.
e.g. pictur of broken device, scaning of a bill or charge.
channel
A ChannelRef. The channel to which the resource reference to.
e.g. channel for selling product offerings, channel for opening a
trouble ticket etc..
creationDate
A DateTime. The date on which the trouble ticket was created.
description
A String. Description of the trouble or issue.
expectedResolutionDate
A DateTime. The expected resolution date determined by the

externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

A RelatedPartyRefOrPartyRoleRef. Parties who manage or
otherwise have an interest in this specification.
specCharacteristic
A CharacteristicSpecification. List of characteristics that the
entity can take.
validFor
A TimePeriod. A period of time, either as a deadline
(endDateTime only) a startDateTime only, or both.
version
A String. The version of the trouble ticket specification, in case it
is desired to maintain multiple versions of trouble ticket
specifications.

CharacteristicSpecification sub-resource fields
charSpecRelationship
A CharacteristicSpecificationRelationship. An aggregation,
migration, substitution, dependency or exclusivity relationship
between/among Specification Characteristics.
characteristicValueSpecification
A CharacteristicValueSpecification. A
CharacteristicValueSpecification object is used to define a set of
attributes, each of which can be assigned to a corresponding set
of attributes in a CharacteristicSpecification object. The values of
the attributes in the CharacteristicValueSpecification object
describe the values of the attributes that a corresponding
Characteristic object can take on.
configurable
A Boolean. If true, the Boolean indicates that the target
Characteristic is configurable.
description
A String. A narrative that explains the CharacteristicSpecification.
extensible
A Boolean. An indicator that specifies that the values for the
characteristic can be extended by adding new values when
instantiating a characteristic for a resource.
id
A String. Unique ID for the characteristic.
isUnique
A Boolean. Specifies if the value of this characteristic is unique
across all entities instantiated from the specification that uses
this characteristc. For example, consider a ProductSpecification
for a set-top box, with a CharacteristicSpecification cardID. Each
set-top box must have a different value for cardID, so this
isUnique attribute would be set to true for the characteristic.
maxCardinality
An Integer. The maximum number of instances a
CharacteristicValue can take on. For example, zero to five phone
numbers in a group calling plan, where five is the value for the
maxCardinality.
minCardinality
An Integer. The minimum number of instances a
CharacteristicValue can take on. For example, zero to five phone
numbers in a group calling plan, where zero is the value for the
minCardinality.

Updates partially a TroubleTicket
PATCH /troubleTicket/{id}?fields=…
Description


 
This operation allows partial updates of a TroubleTicket entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

Updates partially a TroubleTicketSpecification
PATCH /troubleTicketSpecification/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a TroubleTicketSpecification entity. Support of
json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) 
is 
mandatory, 
support 
of 
json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""

Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description

Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
