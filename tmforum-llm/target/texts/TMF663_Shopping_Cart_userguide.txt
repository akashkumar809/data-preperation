 Introduction
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Shopping Cart. It includes the
model definition as well as all available operations.
Shopping Cart is the necessary component in modern sales channel both for online
channel of e-commerce and call center and physical stores. It allows visitors to the shopping
site to select items for eventual purchase. It provides a means of capturing a user purchase
requirement, to accumulate a list of items for purchase, described as “placing items in the
shopping cart” or “adding to cart.” It typically calculates a total charge for the cart including
chosen goods or service, shipping and handling charges and the associated taxes are
typically calculated during the checkout. Shopping cart supports purchase of both tangible
and intangible good and service (e.g. mobile device or family plan). The charge includes the
one-off fee such as the fee for handset and the recurring fee.  The customer will be informed
about the fee information, but only pay the one-off fee after confirming the shopping cart.
The recurring fee may be paid when reaching the bill cycle.
Shopping Cart Item is a contained sub resource. Cart item is the product offering which has
been selected and added into the shopping cart with its price calculation. This item
represents the customer’s request to order, but not finally decided.
The Shopping Cart API provides standardized mechanism for the management of shopping
carts. Including creation, update, retrieval, deletion and notification of event. Shopping Cart
entity is used for the temporarily selection and reservation of product offerings in e-
commerce and retail purchase. Shopping cart supports purchase of both tangible and
intangible goods and service (e.g. handset, telecom network service). The charge includes
the one-off fee such as the fee for handset and the recurring fee such as the fee of a
network service. Shopping Cart contains list of cart items, a reference to party or party role
(e.g. customer) or contact medium in case of unknown customer, in addition the calculated
total items price including promotions and discounts (alterations).


 Sample Use Cases


 Use Case 1: Prospect Purchase Product
Offering using Shopping Cart
This use case describes the prospect selects and purchases the offering using the shopping
cart, and finally proceed to checkout and submits the request to generate the order. Online
shopping portal is available, including the offerings and integration with external systems
such as payment, logistics, workforce management.
• The prospect browses the online shopping portal.
• The prospect browses the offering and chooses what he/she wants to purchase, and add
it into the shopping cart.
• The shopping cart is created for the prospect with the added items and visible for the
prospect to operate on it.
• The customer can also remove the existing item in the cart, or empty it completely.
• The prospect checkout the shopping cart to generate the product order in draft status
(Checkout Flow).
• The prospect required to enroll as customer, customer is generated in CRM system. The
prospect become a customer
• The customer fills in the delivery address for the order.
• The customer finishes payment.
• The order is submitted and it can be tracked.
• The customer comments the purchase process or share the experience.


 Use Case 2: Customer Purchase Product
Offering using Shopping Cart
This use case describes the customer selects and purchases the offering using the  
shopping cart, and finally submits the request to generate the order. Online shopping portal
is available, including the offerings and integration with external systems such as payment,
logistics, workforce management. Customer has logged into the online shopping portal.
• The customer logs into the online shopping portal.
• If the customer has already saved the shopping cart in the previous purchase process
during last time of log-in, the shopping cart can be retrieved and reused.
• The customer browses the offering and chooses what he/she wants to purchase, and
add it into the shopping cart.
• The shopping cart is created for the customer witht he added items and visible for the
customer to operate on it.
• The customer can also removes the existing item in the cart, or empty it completely.
• The customer submits the shopping cart to generate the product order in draft status
(Checkout Flow)
• The customer fills in the delivery address for the order.
• The customer finishes payment.
• The order is submitted and it can be tracked.
The customer comments the purchase process or share the experience.


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a DeliveryCartItem
and InstallationCartItem inheriting properties from CartItem entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 document.
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of CartItem instances some may be instances of DeliveryCartItem
where other could be instances of InstallationCartItem. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an CartItemRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
DeliveryCartItemRef or InstallationCartItemRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.


 RESOURCE MODEL
Managed Entity and Task Resource Models
ShoppingCart resource
Shopping Cart resource is used for the temporarily selection and reservation of product
offerings in e-commerce, call center and retail purchase. Shopping cart supports purchase of
both physical and digital goods and service (e.g. handset, telecom network service).

Updates partially a ShoppingCart
PATCH /shoppingCart/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a ShoppingCart entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
201
