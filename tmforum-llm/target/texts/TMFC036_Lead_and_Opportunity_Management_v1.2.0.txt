5.2. Jira References 
eTOM 
[ISA-710] 1.1.7.4 - Manage Sales Inventory to be reviewed - TM Forum JIRA : As 
currently defined this inventory mixes information related to Lead and Opportunities 
Management (sales prospects) and information related to customer orders (actual 
sales, sales commissions). Do we really need eTOM activities for inventories 
management ? And if yes the scope here corresponds to historic CRM solutions we 
need to spilt in smaller pieces. So this L3 needs to be reviewed and at least duplicates 
entries need to be deleted, and granularity of information managed to be improved. 
[ISA-711] eTOM 1.1.9 - Selling to be reviewed - TM Forum JIRA: this L2 mixes 
activities related to Opportunity and Sales Prospects, but also others related to 
quotation (sales proposal) or product order initialization (cross/Up Sell, negotiate 
sales/contract). A clearer separation is needed. 
SID 
[ISA-712] Sales Lead & Opportunity ABE improvements - TM Forum JIRA :  
• 
2 level 2 ABEs could be created for Sales Lead and for Sales Opportunity 
• 
a relationship between Sales Lead (resp. Sales Opportunity) and Customer 
Product Order could be added 
• 
a relationship between Sales Opportunity and Agreement could also be added 
Functional Framework 
[ISA-713] Functional Fk - review Sales Opportunity Aggregate Function content - TM 
Forum JIRA : Most of the functions classified in this Aggregate Function are not related 
to Sales Opportunity but to quotation or customer product order, so they need to be 
moved - or deleted if duplicates. 
 
 


Open APIs 
TMF699 Sales Management API: 
• 
This API covers Sales Lead and Sales Opportunity management. Sales 
quotation as announced in the introduction as covered later is in fact already 
covered (or should be) by TMF648 Quote Management 
• 
In the resource model of This API the link between Sales Opportunity and Sales 
Quote BEs is missing. 
• 
This API appears in the Early Adoption page only: we need it to be released 
soon.
