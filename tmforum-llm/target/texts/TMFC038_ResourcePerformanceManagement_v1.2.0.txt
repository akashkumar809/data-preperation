Resource 
Performance 
Management 
Resource Performance Management 
processes encompass managing, tracking, 
monitoring, analyzing, controlling and 
reporting on the performance of specific 
resources. They work with basic information 
received from the Resource Data Collection & 
Distribution processes. 
If the analysis identifies a resource 
performance violation or a potential service 
performance violation, information will be 
passed to Resource Trouble Management 
and/or Service Quality Management as 
appropriate. The latter processes are 
responsible for deciding on and carrying out 
the appropriate action/response. This may 
include requests to the Resource 
Performance Management processes to 
install controls to optimize the specific 
resource performance. 


Identifier Level Business 
Activity Name 
Description 
The Resource Performance Management 
processes will continue to track the resource 
performance problem, ensuring that resource 
performance is restored to a level required to 
support services. 
1.5.9.1 
L3 
Monitor 
Resource 
Performance 
The objective of the Monitor Resource 
Performance processes is to monitor received 
resource performance information and 
undertake first-in detection. 
The responsibilities of the processes include, 
but are not limited to: 
•Undertaking the role of first in detection by 
monitoring the received specific resource 
performance data; 
•Comparing the received specific resource 
performance data to performance standards 
set for each specific resource (available from 
the Resource Inventory); 
•Assessing and recording received specific 
resource performance data which is within 
tolerance limits for performance standards, 
and for which continuous monitoring and 
measuring of specific resource performance is 
required; 
•Recording the results of the continuous 
monitoring for reporting through the Report 
Resource Performance processes; 
•Detecting performance threshold violations 
which represent specific resource failures due 
to abnormal performance; 
•Passing information about resource failures 
due to performance threshold violations to 
Resource Trouble Management to manage 
any necessary restoration activity as 
determined by that process; 
•Passing information about potential specific 
service performance degradations arising 
from specific resource degradations to Service 
Quality Management to manage any 
necessary restoration activity as determined 
by that process; 
•Detecting performance degradation for 
specific resources which provide early 
warning of potential issues; 
•Forwarding resource performance 
degradation notifications to other Resource 
Performance Management processes, which 
manage activities to restore normal specific 
resource performance 
•Logging specific resource performance 
degradation and violation details within the

Analyze 
Resource 
Performance  
The objective of the Analyze Resource 
Performance processes is to analyze the 
information received from the Monitor 
Resource Performance process to evaluate 
the performance of a specific resource. 
The responsibilities of the processes include, 
but are not limited to: 
•Undertaking analysis as required on specific 
resource performance information received 
from the Monitor Resource Performance 
processes; 
•Initiating, modifying and cancelling 
continuous performance data collection 
schedules for specific resources required to 
analyze specific resource 
performance.  These schedules are 
established through requests sent to the 
Enable Resource Data Collection & 
Distribution  processes; 
•Determining the root causes of specific 
resource performance degradations and 
violations; 
•Recording the results of the analysis and 
intermediate updates in the Resource 
Inventory for historical analysis and for use as 
required by other processes 
•Undertaking specific detailed analysis (if the 
original requested came from Service Quality 
Management processes) to discover the root 
cause of service performance degradations 
that may be arising due to interactions 
between resource instances, without any 
specific resource instance having an 
unacceptable performance in its own right. 
1.5.9.4

Report 
Resource 
Performance 
The objective of the Report Resource 
Performance processes is to monitor the 
status of resource performance degradation 
reports, provide notifications of any changes 
and provide management reports. 
These processes are responsible for 
continuously monitoring the status of resource 
performance degradation reports and 
managing notifications to other processes in 
the Resource-Ops and other layers, and to 
other parties registered to receive notifications 
of any status changes.  Notification lists are

Description 
managed and maintained by the Enable 
Resource Performance Management 
processes. 
These processes record, analyze and assess 
the resource performance degradation report 
status changes to provide management 
reports and any specialized summaries of the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the overall 
Resource Performance Management 
process.  These specialized summaries could 
be specific reports required by specific 
audiences. 
1.5.9.5

Create 
Resource 
Performance 
Degradation 
Report 
The objective of the Create Resource 
Performance Degradation Report process is 
to create a new resource performance 
degradation report, modify existing resource 
performance degradation reports, and request 
cancellation of existing resource performance 
degradation reports.   
A new resource performance degradation 
report may be created as a result of specific 
resource performance notifications 
undertaken by the Monitor Resource 
Performance processes, or at the request of 
analysis undertaken by other Service-Ops or 
Resource-Ops or party management 
processes which detect that some form of 
deterioration or failure has occurred requires 
an assessment of the specific resource 
performance. 
If the resource performance degradation 
report is created as a result of a notification or 
request from processes other than Monitor 
Resource Performance processes, the Create 
Resource Performance Degradation Report 
processes are responsible for converting the 
received information into a form suitable for 
the Resource Performance Management 
processes, and for requesting additional 
information if required.

The objective of the Close Resource 
Performance Degradation Report processes is 
to close a resource performance degradation 
report when the resource performance has 
been resolved. 
These processes monitor the status of all 
open resource performance degradation 
reports, and recognize that a resource
