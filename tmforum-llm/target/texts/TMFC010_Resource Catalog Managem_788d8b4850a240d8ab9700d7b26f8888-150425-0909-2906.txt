Resource Specification Management business process leverages captured resource requirements to develop, master, analyze, and update documented standard 
conditions that must be satisfied by a resource design and/or delivery.
Resource Specifications Management can result in establishing in a centralized way, technical (know-how) standards. Such standards provide the organization with 
a means to control and approve the values and inputs of specification through structure, review, approval and distribution processes to stakeholders and suppliers.

Resource SpecificationDevelopment & Retirement processes develop new, or enhance existing technologies and associated resource types, so that new Products 
are available to be sold to customers. They use the capability definition or requirements defined by Resource Strategy & Planning They also decide whether to 
acquire resources from outside, taking into account the overall business policy in that respect. These processes also retire or remove technology and associated 
resource types, which are no longer required by the enterprise.
Resource types may be built, or in some cases leased from other parties. To ensure the most efficient and effective solution can be used, negotiations on network 
level agreements with other parties are paramount for both building and leasing.
These processes interact strongly with Product and Engaged Party Development processes.

The Develop Detailed Resource Specifications processes provide input to these specifications. The processes ensure that all detailed specifications are produced

Getting issue details...
STATUS
The UsageSpecification is described in the Catalog Management components â at product, service, and resource levels.
As part of the Resource Catalog Component specification, the question has arisen around the need to assess the addition of a ResourceUsage API 
with both ResourceUsage & ResourceUsagSpecification (feedback from Ludovic Robert and Kamal Maghsoudlou). This will be similar to the resource 
level like TMF727 (ServiceUsage)  is for the service level. This is consistent with the SID ABE (resourceUsage & resourceUsageSpec).

ISA-996
Getting issue details...
STATUS
As part of reviewing the Product, Service and Resource Catalogs to align with the updates to the Functional Framework, we realized that a lot of 
functions have either been removed or been re-purposed by Master Data Management. 
Due to this, we had to make a decision to remove all these functions from the Components: 
Removed deleted unclassified functions  (1,2,5,7,9,10, 12,14,15)
Removed functions that used to be related to Catalog management but now have been re-purposed by Master Data Management ((3,4, 
6,11,13)
Our concern is that we may be missing functions for the catalog due to re-use of Master Data Management.
