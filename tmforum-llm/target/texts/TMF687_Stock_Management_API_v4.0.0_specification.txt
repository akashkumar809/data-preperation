Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API TMF687 for Stock Management. It includes the model 
definition as well as all available operations. This API features several resources: 
• 
Product Stock to describe a stock of a product. It features information related to quantity (in stock, min, max, 
reorder) but also Product configuration, place or related party. 
• 
Adjust Product Stock is a resource to request a product Sock quantity adjustment. A reason for adjustment 
could be provided (for example liked to an inventory check) 
• 
Check Product Stock is a task-based resource to check a product configuration availability at a place and a 
date. It is possible for the server side to provide alternate option (if requested not available). 
• 
Reserve Product Stock is used to perform a reservation for a product configuration. The requester could 
provide a specific product stock to be used. A related entity could be provided to link the entity related to 
this reservation (like a product order or quote for example). 
• 
QueryProductStock is a task-based resource to retrieve a list of Product Stock from a list of complex attribute 
(for example all product stock in a given state, in a place and available for a channel) 
 
Stock Management API performs the following operations 
…on Product Stock: 
• 
Retrieval of a product stock or a collection of product stock depending on filter criteria 
• 
Partial update of a product stock (including updating rules) 
• 
Creation of a product stock  
• 
Deletion of product stock (for administration purposes) 
• 
Notification of events on product stock 
o product stock creation 
o product stock deletion 
o product stock state change 
o product stock batch 
o product stock state change 
…on AdjustProductStock, CheckProductStock, QueryProductStock and ReserveProductStock: 
• 
Retrieval of a resource depending on filter criteria – or by id. 
• 
Creation of a resource  
• 
Notification of events  
o for creation 
o for attribute value change 
o for state change 
o for batch

SAMPLE USE CASES 
 
We illustrate in this document several use-cases:  
• 
For product stock we illustrate a description of a stock of “TMFPhone x-9” in shop & available in the Lyon 
shop. We have all information related to this stock as min/max/reorder qty or next replenishment date. 
• 
For adjust Product Stock we request to change previous product stock quantity following an inventory check. 
• 
For check, a requester asks for an 128GB TMFPhone x-9 availability in the Lyon shop. This item is not available 
but an alternate is available: a 256GB TMFPhone x-9. Because request is ok to get alternate this proposal is 
sent in the response. 
• 
For reserve product Stock, we reserve this 256GB TMFPhone x-9 in the Lyon shop. The product order related 
to this reservation is part of the resource information. 
• 
For query Product stock we look for TMFPhone x-9 available in a defined search zone- In the response we 
have 2 shops listed with this product.

Support of polymorphism and extension  
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, 
for instance a Stock or WarehouseStock inheriting properties from the base ProductStock entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
ProductStock instances some may be instances of Stock where other could be instances of WarehouseStock. The 
@type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be 
provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a RelatedParty object) to explicitly denote 
the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class 
type of the reference itself, such as RelatedParty, and not the class type of the referred object. However, since 
reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been extended

Patch product stock 
  PATCH /productStock/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a product stock entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here. 
Patchable and Non Patchable Attributes 
The tables below provide the list of patchable and non patchable attributes, including constraint rules on their 
usage.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST notification POST 
calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST Guidelines 
reproduced below. 
 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.

Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be replaced by 
one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY 
refers to the data structure of the given notification type. 
 
Request 
 
POST /client/listener 
Accept: application/json 
 
{ 
    "event": {  
                EVENT BODY  
            }, 
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE" 
} 
 
 
Response 
 
201
