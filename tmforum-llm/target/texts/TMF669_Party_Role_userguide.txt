 Introduction
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Party Role management. It
includes the model definition as well as all available operations.
This API can be seen as a generalization of TMF629 Customer Management API where
Party Roles may be any – not only a Customer. It shares the same data structure as the
TMF629 Customer Management API but its use is intended for more general cases.
Although Customer is a subclass of PartyRole, this Customer resource is not managed by
this API but by TMF629 CustomerManagement API.
This API defines 2 resources:
• PartyRole: it is the basis data for a partyRole (customer, partner…). It is the business
incarnation of the Party. It assumes the use of the following API :
 — the TMF632 Party Management API for access to parties
 — the TMF666 Account Management API for definition of accounts
 — the TMF651 Agreement Management API for agreement definition
• PartyRoleSpecification: this resource provides characteristics to describe a partyRole
and the context where the partyRole is created. A partyRoleSpecification contains a
reference to an array of permissionSpecificationSet (see TMF672 User Roles and
Permissions API). They provide information on the permissions to build when creating a
new PartyRole.
This API plays an important role in the global party domain relating to TMF672 User Roles
and Permissions API, TMF632 Party Management API, TMF669 Party Role Management
API, TMF629 Customer Management API, TMF720 Digital Identity Management API,
TMF691 Federated Identity API and TMF639 Resource Management API. In summary,
these TM Forum Open APIs are related to managing parties and their associated roles and
digital identities within a network, as well as controlling access to information and resources
through user roles and permissions. They provide a standardized way for organizations to
manage these processes and enable integration with other systems. Following diagram
illustrates the involved entities in a global party domain overview, referencing related TM
Forum Open APIs and resource model entities:


 
Notes :
• in this document all examples have a @type=PartyRole for simplicity, but
implementations should use specialized schemas like Supplier or BusinessPartner for
instance.
• even if Customer inherits from PartyRole, this Customer specialized schema has not
been put in the PartyRole and PartyOrPartyRole discriminator list just to not overload this
API specification with complete Customer schema, and to not have duplication between
this API and the TMF629 Customer Management API.


 Sample Use Cases
Reader will find examples of use cases using this API in “IG1228 How to use ODA”
document.
This section includes a set of main use cases that can be performed with this API. Additional
use cases can be generated using the operations and resources defined in this specification.
• In a digital identity context (see TMF720 Digital Identity), a partyRole can be used to
represent the parties identified by this digital identity.
• A partyRoleSpecification resource can be created to manage a given user profile
(“catalog administrator” for example). In this case, the partyRoleSpecification resource
will precise the various characteristics that are to be selected when creating a new
catalog administrator partyRole (“mobile catalog”, “internet/TV catalog”, “B2B catalog”, …
).
• If a partyRoleSpecification contains one or more permissionSpecificationSet references
(PermissionSpecificationSetRef), this gives information on the related permissions that
are 
to 
be 
created 
when 
a 
new 
partyRole 
is 
created 
linked 
with 
this
partyRoleSpecification.


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

Notification Resource Models
8 notifications are defined for this API.
Notifications related to PartyRole:


 • Party Role State Change Event
• Party Role Create Event
• Party Role Delete Event
• Party Role Attribute Value Change Event
Notifications related to PartyRoleSpecification:
• Party Role Specification Delete Event
• Party Role Specification State Change Event
• Party Role Specification Attribute Value Change Event
• Party Role Specification Create Event
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the
figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub
class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId),
an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification
structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field
("resourceName" placeholder).

Updates partially a PartyRole
PATCH /partyRole/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a PartyRole entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/


 
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

Updates partially a PartyRoleSpecification
PATCH /partyRoleSpecification/{id}?fields=…


 
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a PartyRoleSpecification entity. Support of
json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) 
is 
mandatory, 
support 
of 
json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
