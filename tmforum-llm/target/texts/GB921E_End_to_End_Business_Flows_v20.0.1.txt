Executive Summary 
 
Due to increasing competition in the global telecommunication markets, it is essential for telecom 
operators to continuously improve their cost and quality position. 
Within this context, the definition of efficient and customer-oriented business processes is a 
crucial success factor. The Business Process Framework eTOM comprises of functional process 
structures, i.e. Market/Sales, Product, Customer, Service, Resource and Engaged Party processes. 
The Process Model discussed in this paper complements eTOM by providing an end-to-end 
process flow driven view to the different functional groupings. Within the TM Forum Business 
Process Framework eTOM Levels 1–3 already exists as a standard. However, the implementation 
of this standard can be facilitated through the further enhancement in terms of process flows at 
Level 3 as demonstrated in Figure 1. Therefore, this document gives clear recommendations on 
how to develop the core Customer Centric, Network and Product process flows which are 
compliant with eTOM Level 1–3. 
This document is an Application Note, aiming to document an approach based on industry 
experience that sets out a structure for considering how these flows can be organized against the 
overall business needs, and provides a number of process flows that address these needs. Note 
that, as an Application Note, this material should not be read as normative – i.e. a single 
standardized approach – but rather as a representative mechanism that provides a useful base for 
others to build on. Other approaches, with different organizational structures which may lead to 
other process flows, are also possible. It is the goal of work like this to assist convergence for the 
industry, but not to impose a single approach, where there are other variations and alternatives 
that make sense. 
The original process flows were first published in April 2011 (Release 9.1). Since then the original 
process flows have been redesigned and updated as part of the development of the Releases 13.5, 
15.0 and 16.0. 
 
 
 


Introduction 
 
Due to increasing competition in the global telecommunication markets, it is essential for telecom 
operators to continuously improve their cost and quality position. One of the most renowned and 
discussed approaches for improving competitiveness in the last decade is Business Process 
Management. Business Process Management is about improving organizational performance 
through the definition, implementation and management of operational, as well as enterprise 
(management) processes. 
Over the last years, customer satisfaction has become one of the most critical factors to success in 
an environment which is characterized by growing market transparency, increasing demands from 
the customers, and reduced customer loyalty. By improving customer loyalty, existing turnover 
can be secured or even increased – either through growth in terms of turnover per existing 
customer, or through new customers. The key to success is, however, not purely a case of clever 
customer loyalty programs, but also the consistent orientation of the core processes towards 
customers’ requirements. The benefit of marketing measures will be short term if customer 
orientation is not taken seriously in terms of the company’s interaction with the customers. 
 
 
Figure 1.  Process Model and eTOM Flows 
  
Within this context, the definition of efficient and customer-oriented business processes is a 
crucial success factor. The Business Process Framework eTOM comprises of functional process 
structures, i.e. Market/Sales, Product, Customer, Service, Resource and Engaged Party processes. 
The Process Model discussed in this paper complements eTOM by providing an end-to-end 
process flow driven view to the different functional groupings. 
Note that this can be considered as a customized extension to the standardized Business Process 
Framework structure, which may be useful for some areas of application. This does not preclude 
other such extensions and customized views, where these are found useful, too. In particular, note 
that the structure shown in Figure 1 and subsequent figures is not a “different” process model, 


Business Process Framework, and no changes to the decomposition structure in the Business 
Process Framework are being introduced here. Instead, the structure shown can be thought of as 
a view of what happens inside a company’s organization, when the process elements from the 
Business Process Framework are allocated to departments and business units. The view on the left 
in Figure 1, which is then shown also in Figure 2, can be considered as such an organizational view, 
and not in any sense in conflict with the decomposition hierarchy of the Business Process 
Framework, since this organizational view makes direct use of the process elements from the 
Business Process Framework. The concepts here are discussed at some length in Addendum G 
“Guide to Applying the Business Process Framework”, and the approach above is in line with this. 
Within the TM Forum Business Process Framework, eTOM Level 1–3 already exists as a standard. 
However, the implementation of this standard can be facilitated through further enhancement in 
terms of process flows at Level 3 as demonstrated in Figure 1. Therefore, this document gives 
clear guidance on how to develop the identified core Customer Centric, Network and Product 
process flows, which are designed to be compliant with eTOM Level 1–3. 
 
 


1. End-to-End Business Streams 
Generally, a service provider can be structured into core business processes, as well as control and 
support processes. One perspective that can be useful for the core business processes is to view 
these as consisting of the Customer Centric processes and three additional process areas: 
Customer, Product and Network. These can be seen to represent process domains arranged as 
end-to-end business streams which show a focus across the Service Provider for the area of 
business activity concerned. Note that the use of the terms “process domains” and “end-to-end 
business streams” here is just intended to explain this broad business context and is not a new 
element of structure or terminology within the core Business Process Framework. 
In this model, the Customer Centric processes are characterized as being initiated by the customer 
and ending at the customer. Additionally, the processes involved include all other core processes, 
which are not directly initiated by a customer (e.g. marketing campaign, product lifecycle 
management, network operations). 
 
 
Figure 2.  A process view focused on customer-centric processes 
 
The Customer Centric processes have several interactions with the other three process 
areas/domains. For instance, they might be initiated by relevant activities in the sense of CRM at 
the Customer domain, and interactions may include trouble solving in the Network domain and 
the Product domain.

1.1. Customer Centric End to End Business Streams 
A total of seven Customer Centric Processes represent the customer view and interaction with the 
telecommunication company. These processes start with the customer initiating the contact. They 
end with the fulfilment of his/her request. Customer Centric processes include activities such as 
handling information requests, new sale, billing and invoice generation or problem and complaint 
handling. 
 
 
Figure 4.  Customer-Centric processes 
1.2. Network End-to-End Business Streams 
This domain consists of six Network processes, which represent the network operations’ view and 
interaction within the telecommunications company. Network processes include activities such as

5. Engaged Party Flows 
This section includes sample process-flows (eTOM level 3) relevant to the Engaged Party Flows. 
The process-flows show how to apply the Engaged Party Domain, a part of eTOM to six phases of 
procurement process. 
We look at addressing the “Effective management of procurement process using Business 
Process Framework (eTOM)”.There are various processes in industry to carry out procurement, 
but doing it in a standard, well known, flexible approach will have a good value addition 
throughout procurement lifecycle. 
Hence, we choose to decompose and identify standard business process from Engaged Party of 
Business Process Framework which can be easily mapped to various phases of procurement 
process. We may not be able to get one-to-one mapping of procurement phase against eTOM 
processes, however we can identify the applicable group of processes. 
5.1. Process Flows for Procurement using Engaged Party 
5.1.1. 
Overview 
• 
Procurement process is a key activity for any organization which gets complex and challenging 
with growing need for value addition. Likewise, there is always parallel need of standard, easy 
to adopt, industry-neutral process definition for procurement. The example defined in this 
document tries to address this and provide best practice that can be derived from business 
process framework. 
• 
The idea behind this case study is to provide a road map and best practices organizations can 
use during procurement process using standards defined in Frameworx. 
• 
As mentioned, this section decomposes/ identifies process involved till Level 3 of business 
process framework that can be mapped to various phases of procurement process. 
  
5.1.2. 
Assumptions 
• 
In the scope of this example, process involving performance and problem reporting of external 
parties is not considered. This can be included as part of next versions of document. This case 
study was originally based on Frameworx 14.5 Model and was updated according to the latest 
16.0 Model. Engaged party domain is considered throughout the case study (since the Supply 
partner domain was replaced with Engaged party domain). This process can be fully 
automated, but in some cases manual activities are also in scope. 
. 
5.1.3. 
Phases of procurement: 
Below flow depicts procurement process at high level and the idea is to make this model as 
domain/industry neutral as possible. 


 
Figure 70.  Phases of Procurement Process 
 
• 
Phase 1: Define Scope of work/Definition of work: Define and review the definition of work, 
Intellectual property considerations, vendor selection method etc. 
• 
Phase 2: Verify Vendors and Issue RFP – Collect information about the vendors list and 
issue   RFP stating details. If required, conduct a session on RFP briefing. 
• 
Phase 3: Validate RFP response – verify RFP response from vendors including commercials, 
SOW and technical requirements and other criteria. 
• 
Phase 4: Purchase Agreement/ Formal award of contract – Publish contract award notice to 
selected vendor. Explain the terms and conditions of contract. 
• 
Phase 5: Contract Management – Set up a kick-off meeting, conduct regular follow up on 
progress of work. 
• 
Phase 6: Post Contract – review the overall progress and milestones accordingly. 
5.1.4. 
eTOM Mapping 
We can now choose which processes from the Business Process Framework are needed, based on 
the definition of the business problem set out originally, and based on the various phases of 
procurement .We inspect the Business Process Framework and identify where the main focus of 
process activity is for the case concerned . 
 
Procurement – Phase 1 to 4: 
In this section let us try to map eTOM processes to phase 1,2,3 and 4 of procurement process 
defined in section 4.1.5. Phase 4 of procurement is spanned across two parts in this document for 
the ease of understanding and continuity. 
Identification of L1 process: 
As we start with Mapping of business process framework with various phases of procurement, it 
can be observed that L1– Engaged Party Domain is involved. We may not be able to identify one- 
to-one mapping of procurement phase against eTOM processes; however, we can identify the 
applicable group of processes. L1 process identified is common for all phases of procurement. 
  


 
Figure 71.  Level 1 Process Framework mapping for procurement process 
 
We observe that each of Level1 process identified can further be detailed to L2, L3 and L4 process 
depending on complexity involved and granularity needed at various stages. Let us identify L2 
process from identified L1 process. 
  
Identification of L2 process:  
 
Figure 72.    Identification of Level 2 process in “Engaged Party Domain (L1)” 
 
Now we have a set of Level 2 process elements that we can use to address each phase of 
procurement process. These processes can be mapped to phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 of procurement. 
Level 2 processes identified are: 
1. Party Strategy and Planning, Party Tender Management, Party Engagement Development and 
Retirement, Party Agreement Management, Party Settlements & Payments Management from 
L1- Engaged Party Domain 


service provider/vendor. 
Now, let us identify L3 process from identified L2 processes. 
Identification of L3 process: 
 
Figure 73.  Identification of Level 3 process in “Party Tender Management (L2)” 
 
  
Figure 74.  Identification of Level 3 process in “Party Engagement Development and Retirement (L2)” 
 
 
Figure 75.  Identification of Level 3 process in “Party Agreement Management (L2)” 
 
Figure above depicts the processes that can be mapped to L3 process under L2 process. This 
process defines policies, principles and performance standards of the organization which need to 
be adhere by vendor/external service provider. 
Example: a process defining SLA for a software system. 
 
Now we have a set of Level 3 process elements that we can use to address each phase of 
procurement process. These processes can be mapped to phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 of procurement. 
Level 3 processes identified are  
1. Determine Sourcing Requirements, Determine Potential Parties, Manage Tender Process from 
d


3. Negotiate Commercial Arrangements, Gain Approval of Commercial Arrangements, and 
Establish Party Agreement from L2 Party Agreement Management. 
 
Procurement – phase 4, 5 and 6: 
Processes decomposed in this section are applicable to procurement phase 5 and 6 (defined in 
section 4.1.5 of this document)  - awarding contract ,contract management and post contract 
phase. It is to be observed that phase 4 has spanned across two sections as process related to 
supplier identification /award/maintaining spans across multiple processes. Now, let us identify 
Level 2 process from identified L1 process. 
Identification of L2 process: 
 
Figure 76.  Identification of Level 2 process in “Engaged party domain (L1)” 
 
Now we have a set of Level 2 process elements that we can use to address each phase of 
procurement process. These processes can be mapped to phase 4, 5 and 6 of procurement. 
Level 2 processes identified are: 
1. Party Engagement Development & Retirement, Party Support & Readiness, Party Agreement 
Management, Party Settlements & Payments Management from L1- Engaged Party Domain. 
 
Now, let us identify Level 3 process from identified L2 process. 
 
Identification of L3 process:  
 
 
Figure 77.  Identification of Level 3 process in “Party Engagement Development & Retirement (L2)” 
 


 
Figure 78.  Identification of Level 3 process in “Party Agreement Management (L2)” 
 
Now we have a set of Level 3 process elements that we can use to address each phase of 
procurement process further. These processes can be mapped to phase 4, 5 and 6 of 
procurement. 
Level 3 processes identified are   
1. Manage Party Engagement and Terminate Party Engagement in L2 Party Engagement 
Development & Retirement. 
2. Manage Party Agreement Violation and Terminate Party Agreement from L2 Party Agreement 
Management. 
3. All of the processes in L2: Party Settlements & Payments Management   
4. All of the processes in L2: Party Support and Readiness 
  
We observe that Manage Party Engagement process addresses various activities involved post–
awarding contract. Some of the activities can be arranging a kickoff meeting, monitoring and 
tracking the progress, escalations etc. We can also make use of any other process than ones 
identified, depending on the nature of the deal/contract.
