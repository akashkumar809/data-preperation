Introduction 
The present document is the User Guide of the REST API for Resource Function Activation and 
Configuration. It includes the model definition as well as all available operations. 
 
This API is used for the provisioning and lifecycle management of Resource Functions (RF) as 
described in TR255 Resource Function Activation and Configuration. Resource functions are a 
generalization and abstraction of various industry concepts including the ETSI NFV concepts of VNF, 
PNF, VNF Forwarding Graph and Network Service, as well as the SDN concepts of Service Function 
and Service Function Chain and physical network functions such as routers and Content Delivery 
Networks (CDNs). 
This API is a key component in the Hybrid Infrastructure Platform (HIP) defined in TMF070B Advanced 
Platform Deployment Blueprints. HIP, in turn, is based on principles defined in TR262 Management 
Platform Blueprint and Application to Hybrid Infrastructure. TR262 defines a platform-based model, 
supporting autonomic closed control loop resource managers. 
Both intent-based and detailed-based options are defined for configuration of resource functions. In the 
case of intent-based the consumer does not have a view, or the ability to directly affect, the entities 
contained within an RF. For the detailed-based, the opposite is true.

SAMPLE USE CASES 
Please refer to TR255 for detailed background and use cases.  Sample payloads for a few complex use 
cases have been included in this section to assist the user in consuming this API. It is suggested that the 
reader reads the subsequent sections to familiarize herself with the API before coming back to this section. 
USE CASE 1 
This use case requests creation of a composite resource function including creation of some of the 
component RFs and inclusion of some existing RFs. 
This API allows users to request creation of a composite RF composed a number of other atomic or 
composite resources and connected in a topology. A resource function specification describes features and 
characteristics of the composite RF as well as the required component resources, their roles and the 
adjacency relationships among the component resources. 
See the simple example in Figure 1 below where the requirement is to create a new vCDN RF. In this 
example, the Virtual Router Z along with the connection points I, H and K are available. However, the 
components with a red border i.e.  the virtual content server W along with its connection points J & L as well 
as the link A need to be created as part of the request. There is then a requirement to connect these newly 
created components together in a certain topology.

components 
 
A resource function specification for this vCDN will look like this (only the relevant parts of the payload are 
provided).

The previously instantiated RFs above should have referenced component resource specifications of the 
composite RF specification for the vCDN. To avoid ambiguity the role attribute may be used to explicitly 
match an RF to a resource specification. 
Other resources and connectivity will be instantiated as provided in the composite RF specification for the 
vCDN.  
USE CASE 2 
Request creation of a flow on an existing topology. 
The diagram in Figure 2 has been taken from TR255A where the requirement is to create a new flow (red 
line) on the existing topology.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list 
of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit 
from base entities, for instance a LogicalResource and PhysicalResource inheriting properties from the 
Resource entity. In this API ResourceFunction inherits from LogicalResource. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 
2 document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a 
resource inventory collection some may be instances of PhysicalResource where others could be instances 
of ResourceFunction. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have 
a @type attribute that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a ResourceRelationship object) 
to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, 
when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as ResourceRelationship or 
ResourceSpecRelationship, and not the class type of the referred object. However since reference classes 
are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an 
Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has 
been extended.

way of expressing the link) for any other kind of links that may be useful. 
resourceSpecification 
A resource specification reference (ResourceSpecificationRef). Resources are 
physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an

Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, 
Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and 
technology components. 
A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic

Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, 
Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and 
technology components. 
A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic

ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set 
of related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based 
on a particular ResourceSpecification.

Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample 
REST notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the 
REST Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its 
health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if 
it does not support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint 
can be created again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
Request 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null}

Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener 
url is the callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be 
replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) 
and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given notification type.
