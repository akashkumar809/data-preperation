Introduction 
The Risk Management API allows the retrieval of Risk Assessments during interaction with PartyRoles (individuals 
or organizations) typically engaged in an Order process from ProviderPartyRole. The Risk Assessment request is 
usually issued by the ProviderPartyRole (e.g. Service Provider). The resources used to retrieve these assessment are 
Task resources, as per the Open API guidelines for tasks. 
Order related interactions of a PartyRole with a Service Provider entity is done via: Customer Service 
Representative, Call Center, Store, Dealer, Point of Sale, WEB Portal, Applications Portal, USSD Portal, etc. 
Assessed Entities 
Order process related Risk Scores are assessed for the following entities: 
• 
PartyRole – individual or organization playing (or intending to play) a specific role with the service provider 
• 
ProductOffering – a specific offering (not necessarily related with a specific PartyRole) 
• 
PartyRoleProductOffering – a specific offering addressed by the PartyRole (e.g. currently browsed/viewed by 
the PartyRole) 
• 
ShoppingCart – the shopping cart assembled by the PartyRole 
• 
ProductOrder – the overall order bound for payment by the PartyRole 
As the Order Process progresses, the ProviderPartyRole may issue Risk Assessment Scores request for each of the 
above-mentioned entities 
Following a response to a Risk Assessment request, the ProviderPartyRole may practice (its own) relevant Policies, 
for example: 
• 
getting of risk assessment scores for a PartyRole may be require a mandatory request for risk scores for 
PartyRoleOrder (of the same PartyRole). 
• 
getting of risk assessment scores for a ShoppingCart may result in request for an advanced full payment, rather 
than offer installment.

Sample Use Cases 
Assessing Risks of a PartyRole 
Assess Risks related with a PartyRole introduced to an Order process 
 
According to the retrieved PartyRoleRiskAssessment, the Order process may hide specific offerings for that 
PartyRole. If the IDConfidenceRisk assesses a non-genuine PartyRole (e.g. account take-over or false ID credentials), 
the Order process may stop or request additional ID credentials.  
Assessing Risks of a ProductOffering 
Assess Risks related with a ProductOffering, not necessarily related with a PartyRole 
 
 
According to the retrieved ProductOfferingRiskAssessment, the Order process may choose to highlight or hide 
specific offerings to PartyRoles associated with specific Places.

Assessing Risks of a PartyRoleProductOffering

Task Mode of Operation 
The risk assessment tasks may be executed synchronously or asynchronously, according to the specific 
implementation. 
• 
For an implementation that supports synchronous execution, the POST of the task is expected to return an 
immediate result. 
o If the implementation chooses to persist the task (e.g. for accounting purposes), then the id and href 
should be populated in the POST response, and the implementation must support GET and DELETE. 
o If the implementation does not persist the task, then the id and href should not be populated in the 
POST response, and the implementation must not support GET and DELETE. 
• 
For an implementation that supports asynchronous execution, the POST of the task is expected to return an 
interim result, and to raise an event when the execution is complete. The id and href should be populated in 
the POST response, and the implementation must support GET and DELETE.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base 
entities. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
RiskScore instances some may be instances of an enhanced resource RiskScoreWithConfidence (with a confidence 
level added for the score) where other could be instances of the basic RiskScore. The @type gives this information. 
All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred 
class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, and not 
the class type of the referred object. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended, so if @type was RiskScoreWithConfidence then @baseType would be RiskScore.

RESOURCE MODEL 
Managed Entity and Task Resource Models 
Product Offering Risk Assessment resource 
This is a task resource allowing assessment of the risks associated with a product offering. For example, the risk 
associated with iPhone X will probably be higher than the risk for a battery.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null}

Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be replaced by 
one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY 
refers to the data structure of the given notification type.
