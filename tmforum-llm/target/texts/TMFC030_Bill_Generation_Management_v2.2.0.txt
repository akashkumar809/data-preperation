3.  TMF OPEN APIs & Events 
The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 4: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component.  
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs.  
• 
List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may 
consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each 
defined event. 
<Note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is 
required, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the 
new Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In 
addition a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the 
Open API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of 
the component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component 
specification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. 
Alternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to 
publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.>
