TMFC003 This component is in charge of the 
orchestration of the delivery of Product Orders 
(status accepted). 
Based on the Product specification level of 
information available in the Product Catalog 
(ex: prerequisite links between product 
specifications, links between product and CFS 
specifications, ...): 
• 
it determines in which order the 
product specification level order items 
need to be delivered, 
• 
and to which CFS (or Resource) 
specification each ordered product 
corresponds, 
• 
and prepares and addresses each 
related service (or resource) order to 
the production system in charge. 
During the delivery process execution, this 
component is in charge of the evolution of the 
status of the product specification level order 
items, and of the related product items . So, it

• 
 ISA-389 - Improve Manage Order Fallout (1.3.3.8) description and 
decomposition  DONE 1.3.3.8 - Manage Order Fallout: as this L3 is shared by 
POCV and POOM components (to be consistent with Functional Framework 
mapping), clarify which type of fallout need to be managed during the order 
delivery orchestration (at POOM level) and which need to be managed at 
Product Order Capture and Follow-Up level (by POCV). 
5.2.2. 
SID 
• 
 ISA-399 - New BEs to describe Orchestration Plan and Delivery 
Process  BACKLOG Describe Orchestration Plan and delivery process at 
Product Order level. This could be added at least as specialization from Project 
ABE. 
5.2.3. 
Functional Framework 
These updates are already integrated in Functional Framework R22.0: 
• 
Function 174 - Customer Order Error Resolution Support: review the definition 
of this function and may be split it in 2 as it is proposed to be mapped to POCV 
and to POOM 
• 
Function 723 - Customer Order Item Decomposition: term "decomposition" in 
function name or definition doesn't seem appropriate as by definition a product 
order is built up of order items, according to catalog structure of product 
offerings and products 
 
The updates need to be studied for R22.0 or R22.5: 
• 
 ISA-397 - Split Function 342 - Mass Service/product pre-
activation  SME REVIEW Function 342 - Mass Service/product pre-activation: 
need to split this function in 2, one at product level, the other at service level 
• 
 ISA-398 - Review Function 743 - Number Portability 
Orchestration  DONE Function 743 - Number Portability Orchestration: review 
functions related to Number Portability and clarify which level 
(product/service/resource) each of them concern and split if necessary. 


5.2.4. 
API 
• 
 AP-3664 - Manage Amend Order  DONE - Does POOM need to issue 
TMF641 PATCH /serviceOrder and TMF652 PATCH /resourceOrder? We 
cannot think of any scenarios where POOM would need to PATCH a service or 
resource order. PATCH is certainly applicable to other use cases (e.g., to allow 
a user with appropriate privileges to add a note). However, order updates due 
to change in intent should be done through amendments, preferably using a 
task-based mechanism similar to cancellation requests. For example, an 
amendment of a product order would result in a new orchestration plan and 
changes would trickle down to POOM, SOM and ROM as amendment and/or 
cancellation requests. See also On Revisions. We need Amend task operations 
for all P/S/R order APIs.
