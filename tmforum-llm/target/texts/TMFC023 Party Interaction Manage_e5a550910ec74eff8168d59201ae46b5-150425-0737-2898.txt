This will typically be the first component in a party/individual experience journey, shared by unassisted (self-service, retail kiosk) or assisted 
(call center, retail store) channels, for which it is also in charge of queue management. 
Depending on identified/unidentified party, party roles and/or resource roles, this component will react appropriately to propose available 
actions like Identify yourself, Browse Catalog, Start an Order, Register Trouble Ticket. It will delegate the chosen action execution to the 
dedicated component (based on configuration).
It records the interaction, and iteration items corresponding to the chosen actions, for all the parties from all channels.
