Block 
Service Order 
Management 
TMFC007 The SOM is the entry point of the Production 
Domain. It is in charge of Customer-Facing-
Service (CFS) delivery on resources 
(network and service platforms equipment). 
To achieve delivery of a CFS, the SOM 
orchestrates the service order delivery 
process which: 
• 
Identifies the possible technical 
solutions (RFS level) and chooses 
one, using the catalogue rules of 
choice, the technical inventory and 
the configuration of the service order. 
• 
Selects the resources (servers, 
equipment, etc.) and their instances. 
• 
Triggers work orders when 
technicians need to take actions 
• 
Requests the ROM to update 
selected resource instances to 
deliver CFS. Request sent to the 
ROM contains the CFS configuration 
and the list of resource instances to 
update. 
• 
Triggers tests to ensure the correct 
delivery of the service 
 
SOM components can collaborate, so a 
SOM can also be triggered to deliver a 
subset of a technical solution (RFS level). 
Service Orders can correspond to 
customer's Product Orders or to operator's 
internal needs to deploy new infrastructures 
or to develop its technical solutions.

Identification Function 
identifies the installed

of the chosen technical 
solution, to deliver the 
ordered service (CFS). 
This information enrich the 
CFS order and the CFS. 
This choice is based on 
service catalogue rules 
(between RFS specification 
and Resources specification) 
and it can be necessary to 
check the installed resources 
availability, occupancy, etc. 
via the Resource Availability 
function. 
Cloud example: In case of a 
cloud service, the Service 
Order Delivery process only 
identifies the equipment in 
charge of the management of 
the cloud infrastructure and it 
will be informed of the 
ordered service 
characteristics. Depending on 
its own rules, the cloud 
infrastructure manager will 
decide or not to immediately 
allocate and configure all or 
part of the required resources. 
So the first usage request of 
the cloud service can trigger 
the effective choice and 
configuration of the necessary 
resources and these 
resources can change

In the case of a Service 
associated with an existing 
Internal Resource Type, this 
function also allows to:  
• check if a corresponding 
Installed Resource is 
operational in the resource 
installed base, and determine 
the operation to be performed

• eventually group in the same

3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events 
 
The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component.  
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs.  
• 
List of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may 
consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each 
defined event. 
 
<Note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is 
required, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the 
new Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In 
addition, a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the 
Open API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of 
the component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component 
specification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. 
Alternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to 
publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.>

3.3. Events 
The diagram illustrates the Events which the component may publish and the Events 
that the component may subscribe to and then may receive. Both lists are derived from 
the APIs listed in the preceding sections. 


 
 
Event name always follow same pattern: <<Resource>> + <<Type of Event>> + 
"Event" 
The type of event could be: 
• 
Create : a new resource has been created (following a POST). 
• 
Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. 
• 
AttributeValueChange: an attribute from the resource has changed - event 
structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing 
to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
StateChange: resource state has changed.
