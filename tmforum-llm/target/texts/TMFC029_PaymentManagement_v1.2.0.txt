The purpose of the Manage Customer

payments to the invoices. This process is 
meant to match these payments with the 
services/invoices delivered to this customer. 
These processes can include credit/debit/EFT 
payments using various channels, either 
directly or through third parties, and cash or 
check payments, either directly or through 
third parties. 
In all the above cases these processes are 
responsible for the processes interacting with 
the customers and/or the third parties.  The 
processes are also responsible for 
establishing managing back-end bank 
accounts for receipt of the customer payments 
and for the transfer of funds collected by third 
parties.  These processes are responsible for 
reconciling the money received into the bank 
accounts against the payments expected in 
the invoices. Additionally, these processes 
inform the Financial Management on all those 
payments for updating the ledger.

2.2. SID ABEs 
<Note not to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new ABE is required, 
but it does not yet exist in SID. Then you should include a textual description of the 
new ABE, and it should be clearly noted that this ABE does not yet exist. In addition, a 
Jira epic should be raised to request the new ABE is added to SID, and the SID team 
should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the component 
without this ABE. If the ABE is critical then the component specification should not be 
published until the ABE issue has been resolved. Alternatively, if the ABE is not critical, 
then the specification could continue to publication. The result of this decision should 
be clearly recorded.>
