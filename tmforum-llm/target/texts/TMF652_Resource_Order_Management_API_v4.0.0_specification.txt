Introduction 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for Resource Order Management. It includes the model 
definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are creating, updating and retrieving Resource Orders 
(including filtering). 
A Resource Order API provides a standard mechanism for placing a Resource Order with all necessary order 
parameters. A Resource Order is created based on a resource candidate that is defined in the resource catalog. The 
Resource candidate is an entity that makes a Resource Specification available to a resource catalog. 
Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an enterprise's 
infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by Services (for example a physical port assigned 
to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the 
Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, 
content and information, and technology components. 
A Resource Specification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a particular 
type of Resource. In essence, a Resource Specification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set of 
related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a particular Resource Specification. 
Resource Order API manages resource order resource: 
- 
A Resource Order is a type of order which can be used to place an order between a service provider and a 
partner and vice versa 
- 
Main order items attributes are the orders resource candidates and resource characteristics with the 
related action to be performed (e.g: add or delete resources), state. 
Resource Order API performs the following operations on the Resource Order: 
- 
Retrieval of a Resource Order or a collection of Resource Orders depending on filter criteria 
- 
Partial update of a ResourceOrder 
- 
Creation of a Resource order 
- 
Deletion of a resource order (for admin purposes) 
- 
Notifications of events on resource order 
o Order creation 
o Order removal 
o Order state change 
o Order value change 
o Order information required 
The following Assumptions were considered in the development of this document: 
- 
The Order Management system has access to the catalog system 


SAMPLE USE CASES 
Ordering Optical Cable 
  
There is a use-case through the examples provided: 
The operator is buying 7km of optical cable (the Physical Resource) made by FiberOpticsRUs (in the role of 
Manufacturer) on behalf of Acme Inc (in the role of Customer). There is a note (of type Note) associated with this 
order, and a link to a previous Site Survey (Appointment). The order is known to Acme under its own internal ordering 
number (passed as an âExternalReferenceâ). The Account manager (an Individual related party in the role of Account 
Manager) is Gwen Howells. 
Once created, later examples show: 
- 
Retrieval of orders under a Premium category 
- 
Update this order to change the priority to 2 
- 
Delete this order using its id: 5130d5131a23 


Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, 
for instance a LogicalResource and PhysicalResource inheriting properties from the abstract Resource entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of 
Resource instances some may be instances of LogicalResource where other could be instances of PhysicalResource. 
The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be 
provided when this is useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a ResourceRef object) to explicitly denote 
the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class 
type of the reference itself, such as LogicalResourceRef or PhysicalResourceRef, and not the class type of the referred 
object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

ResourceSpecificationRef relationship 
Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an enterprise's 
infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services (for example a physical port assigned 
to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the 
Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, 
content and information, and technology components. 
 
 


A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a particular 
type of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set of 
related Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a particular ResourceSpecification. 
@referredType 
A string. The actual type of the target instance when needed for disambiguation. 
name 
A string. Name of the related entity. 
href 
An uri (Uri). Hyperlink reference.

Notification Resource Models 
 
8 notifications are defined for this API 
Notifications related to ResourceOrder: 
    - ResourceOrderCreateEvent 
    - ResourceOrderAttributeValueChangeEvent 
    - ResourceOrderStateChangeEvent 
    - ResourceOrderDeleteEvent 
    - ResourceOrderInformationRequiredEvent 
Notifications related to CancelResourceOrder: 
    - CancelResourceOrderCreateEvent 
    - CancelResourceOrderStateChangeEvent 
    - CancelResourceOrderInformationRequiredEvent 
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic Event structure 
containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the 
resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the 
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder).

Patch resource order 
  PATCH /resourceOrder/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a resource order entity. Support of json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is 
optional. 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
Register listener 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health 
state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not 
support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created 
again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null} 
 
 
 
 


 
Unregister listener 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
Publish Event to listener 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
 
 


Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example âEVENT TYPEâ should be replaced by 
one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY 
refers to the data structure of the given notification type. 
 
Request 
 
POST /client/listener 
Accept: application/json 
 
{ 
    "event": {  
        EVENT BODY  
    }, 
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE" 
} 
 
 
Response 
 
201
