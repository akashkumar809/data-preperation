 General Information 
This document contains the text of the Business Process Framework for context and more information please refer to âGB991 Core Frameworks Concepts
and Principlesâ guidebook. 
 Preface 
eTOM Business Process Framework 
The eTOM or Business Process Framework is a reference framework for categorizing all the business activities used by an enterprise involved in delivering
on-line Information, Communications and Entertainment services. This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process 
components or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to
show organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. 
The eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and
the starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional 
application for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an 
industry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with 
other enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required 
functions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. 
 Introduction 
This document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out 
this domain. 
The focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke
Product, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes. 


that occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then
describing a unique path of action and further detail the specific process. This is then repeated to lower level of granularly of up to seven levees.  
At the start of each Level 2 process a diagram details all of its sub processes is placed. This diagram showers Level 3 process and the level 4 process 
below them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition
include another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   
Process Associations and IDs 
To aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. 
Processes have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: 
.b.x.c.d.e where  
 
b: 
This digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses 
to  
extended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   
x: 
Digit representing Domain  
c: 
Digit representing Level 2 process 
d: 
Digit representing Level 4 process 
e: 
Digit representing Level 5 process 
The unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. 


Typographic Conventions 
 
Â·  A Business Process is represented by a decorator in form of an arrow located to the top right. A red dot decorator with the initial TMF indicates that 
this is a TM Forum Business Process. The color yellow background hints to the business  layer.

The purpose of this process is to close the sale with terms that are understood by the customer, and are mutually agreeable to both the customer and the 
service provider. This process may involve obtaining customer agreement to standard terms and conditions. The agreement process may require 
interaction with the customer to ensure that the standard terms and conditions are understood by, and are acceptable to, the customer. 
In some cases this process may involve the development of, and negotiation with the customer of, non-standard terms and conditions associated with sale
proposals specifically developed to meet specific customer requirements. For complex sales proposals associated with customer RFPs this process may 
extend over long time periods and require extensive interaction with customers to achieve agreement. Aspects of contract price determination may include 
issues of CPE prices from third party vendors, allowances based on customer location, etc. For RFPs, many of the commercial terms being sought may be
developed or originated by the customer, and the negotiating team may need to develop strategies to achieve acceptable commercial outcomes. The sale 
is concluded through negotiations and joint agreement on features, service levels, pricing and discounts, resulting in a sign-off formal agreement/contract 
between the customer and service provider. Depending upon specific circumstances, final agreement from the Service Providerâs perspective may require 
escalation to, and agreement from, an appropriately delegated manager. The formal agreement could include zero or more confirmed orders from the 
customer. These orders are then passed on as requests to allow formal Customer Orders to be generated and processed.

Contact/Lead/Prospect Management develops the appropriate relationships with contacts, leads, and prospects with the intent to convert them to 
consumers, such as customers, or providers, such as partners, of an enterprise's offerings. 
Traditionally this process focuses on a future/existing customer perspective. However, these processes, particularly in todayâs digital ecosystem, also do, o
should, focus on these from a party, such as a partner, who may offer an enterpriseâs offerings to the market and acquire them in some form, either by on-
boarding the enterpriseâs offerings and fulfilling orders for them directly, or offering them and passing orders on to the enterprise. These parties who 
represent âconsumersâ of an enterpriseâs offerings and âprovidersâ of enterpriseâs offerings move through a similar contact/lead/prospect lifecycle and are 
targets for an enterpriseâs selling process. The parties may be those with whom the business already has a relationship, but represent possible new selling
opportunities for an enterprise. 
 
This process interacts with the Party Relationship Development & Retirement process to collect data about a party. 
 
Note: There is no strict rule that a party has to move from contact to lead to prospect and then to the Selling process. A contact could become a prospect.
