 Introduction
The scope of this document is to define the Product Configuration API exposed by the
Product Configurator ODA component (TMFC027). The telecommunications industry has
witnessed a significant shift towards digital customer engagement channels such as mobile
apps and self-care portals. While these channels support a wide range of actions, ensuring
consistency in product and pricing rules and policies across channels can be a challenge.
CSPs must implement changes rapidly while keeping costs low, and consistency in product
and pricing rules must be maintained regardless of the customer touchpoint.
To address these issues, the Product Configurator component exposes the Product
Configuration API, providing sales representatives and customers with a fast and error-free
product configuration capability across all channels.
The Product Configurator ODA component exposes a Product Offering Qualification API
(TMF679) that is used to establish commercial offering eligibility and provide alternative
product offerings in case of ineligible product offering selection. TMF679 is used in the
product offering discovery phase (browsing the catalog and establishing eligibility in a given
context). The Product Configuration API is invoked after qualification has been established
using TMF679 and leads the configuration of selected eligible product offerings in a given
context. Product configuration includes computation of characteristic values, allowed values,
characteristic metadata, bundled and related product offerings, pricing, and discounts.
The Product Configuration API computes product configurations based on contextual
information, existing product inventory, product catalog rules, product policy rules, and other
information provided by engagement management (e.g. characteristic values). The Product
Configuration API is used for a range of different use-cases in pre-ordering and product
ordering processes across all channels.


 
High-level architecture
The product Configuration API drives the configuration of selected product offering or
selected product instance in a given context.
The Product Configuration API computes product configurations based on:
• product catalog (TMF620) and specific policy rules (TMF723),
• customer’s existing product inventory or past purchases (TMF637),
• specific contextual information provided by the engagement management as input, e.g.
PartyRole (Customer), sales representative, channel, etc.
The Product Configuration API is engaged by various engagement management systems to
support a range of different scenarios and use-cases, e.g.:
• quote management / Configure-Price-Quote (CPQ) in pre-ordering use-cases,
• product ordering in product ordering use-cases,
• shopping cart (E-commerce) in customer self-service use-cases,
• different digital engagement channels in various pre-ordering use-cases, e.g. customer
enquiry for a product configuration & pricing prior to placing an item in the cart or placing
a product order (pre-sale discovery).
Figure above shows the architecture and component dependencies. Product Configuration
depends on Product Catalog, Product Inventory, and Policy Management. Product
Configurator is invoked from an appropriate back-end for front-end component of Quote,
Product Ordering, Shopping Cart, or any other user engagement application (which is not
explicitly depicted in the figure below).


 
The use of the Product Configuration API is further explained in the IG1228 document.
Please, refer to the use-case 003 (see TMFXXX API).


 
Configurable products in the telecommunications industry
The product Cofniguration API assists end-users with configuring configurable products and
drives various engagement management UIs. Examples of configurable products in
telecommunications include:
• internet bandwidth selection; basic bandwidth is included in the broadband bundle
monthly fee, while higher bandwidths require a surcharge;
• TV service includes a selection of channels and picture quality (FHD, 4K) as well as
configuration of optional payable add-ons (e.g. HBO, Netflix) which may be priced
depending on parameters of the basic TV service;
• mobile handset configuration including memory storage capacity, handset color, and
subsidy linked to a mobile service contract;
• cross-technology service bundles where a CSP markets a single product offering
regardless of the network technology available at the customer’s premises/site; a single
commercial product offering is configured and priced depending on technical feasibility
(e.g. fiber/copper network, maximum bandwidth determines both, internet speed and
HD/4K IPTV quality);
• on-the-fly configuration of mobile tariff plans; a CSP markets several plans with
predefined total free units; each customer may distribute free units among voice minutes,
SMSs, and mobile data on the subscription level;
• convergent bundles where a single commercial product offering includes a mobile
service, fixed broadband & voice, and TV; each service may be ordered as an
independent subscription, but the bundle offers special discounts and promotions
• SLA/QoS parameters where a certain QoS is included as a part of basic ("guaranteed")
SLA and higher QoS may be available as an optional add-on;
• various SaaS and PaaS subscription products provided by the CSP or its partners and
resold independently or as a part of a connectivity bundle;
• virtual server (re)sold in an IaaS fashion with CPU, memory, and disk space as
configurable parameters and a back-up service as an optional add-on;
• a combination of all the above-mentioned possibilities.


 Sample Use Cases
This section describes the use-cases the Product Cofniguration API supports to configure
products in pre-ordering and product ordering processes.
This section contains 3 full use cases representing the use of the Product Configuration API
from the user’s perspective.
Additionally, these 3 full user stories are broken down into atomic functions that the Product
Configuration API performs.
Full use case 1: new product configuration
User story: as a customer, I want to configure a new product offering (broadband
subscription, mobile subscription) using a selfcare portal.
Alternative user story: as a sales representative, I want to configure a new product offering
for a B2B customer and place it on a quote as a quote item.
A user browses product catalog for desired product offerings. Product configurator is used to
compute commercial eligibility of product offerings (TMF679 API – Product Offering
Qualification).
Once the user selects an eligible product offering, the product configurator computes a
product configuration to configure the product in a given context. Engagement management
uses this product configuration to construct the UI and lead the product configuration.
On user input, product configurator is invoked to recompute the product configuration. This
may include recomputing characteristic values, list of (allowed) values, bundled offerings,
pricing, and discounts.
Once the user finishes configuring the product in a given context, the product configurator
checks the configuration. In case of valid configuration, the BFF may create a quote item,
order item or cart item.


 
Full use case 2: configuration of existint product change
User story: as a customer, I want to change my existing product (e.g. change mobile tariff
plan, increase internet bandwidth, activate a TV add-on) using a selfcare portal.
First, the user is presented with existing products (e.g. subscriptions). The user selects a
product instance and product configurator is invoked to provide a list of available actions
representing move, change, or delete operations. Actions may include pricing.
The user selects an action and product configurator computes a product configuration
representing performing this action on selected product instance. The product configuration
is used to present an appropriate UI.
The user reconfigures the product. On user input the product configurator is invoked to
recompute the product configuration. This may include recomputing characteristic values, list
of (allowed) values, bundled offerings, pricing, and discounts.
Once the user finishes configuring the product in a given context, the product configurator
checks the configuration. In case of valid configuration, the BFF may create a quote item,
order item or cart item.


 
Full use case 3: reconfiguration of a cart/quote/product order item
User story: as a customer, I want to change a shopping cart item (e.g. change characteristic
value, (un)select a bundled offering, add an optional add-on) before the shopping cart has
been submitted.
Alternative user story: as a sales representative, I want to change a quote or product order
item befor ethe quote/product order has been submitted so that the items better reflect
customer’s needs.
First, the user obtains a cart, quote, or product order with all associated items. The
engagement management BFF invokes an appropriate API exposed by the order capture &
validation component (TMF622, TMF649 or TMF663).
The user selects an item for reconfiguration.
The product configuration API (TMF760) is invoked to compute a product configuration. The
product configuration is used to present an appropriate UI. The user reconfigures the
product. On user input the product configurator is invoked to recompute the product
configuration. This may include recomputing characteristic values, list of (allowed) values,
bundled offerings, pricing, and discounts.
Once the user finishes reconfiguring the item in a given context, the product configurator


 
checks the configuration. In case of valid configuration, the BFF updates a quote item, order
item or cart item.
Query a new product configuration for a new root product
A customer wants to buy a new product based on a product offering as defined by the
product catalog. This product offering is sold as a “root” offering, e.g. a mobile tariff plan for a
new mobile subscription or a bundle offering for a new broadband subscription.
The product configurator first evaluates commercial eligibility using product offering
qualification API (TMF679).
Once the eligibility is established, the product configuration API is invoked to compute
appropriate product configuration based on the contextual information. Product configuration
includes a list of characteristics, characteristic values (default, list of allowed values),
bundled product offerings (with groups and group options), and related product offerings.
The engagement management uses product configuration to build appropriate UI to
configure the product.
Product configuration computation includes the following steps:
• product offering & product specification are obtained from the product catalog (TMF620);
• in case there are specific policies associated with the product specification and/or
product offering, policies are obtained (TMF723);


 • product configurator evaluates product and policy rules based on contextual information
provided as input (e.g. party role / customer, channel, sales representative);
• initial pricing is calculated based on product catalog default values and policy rule
execution results;
• initial product configuration is created, including:
◦characteristics with default values and lists of allowed values,
◦bundled product offerings with selected defaults, groups, and group options
◦related product offerings,
To support various pre-ordering and product ordering use-cases, the following user
engagement scenarios should be considered:
• customer quote: user wants to place a quote item for a product offering; product
configuration guides the configuration of the quote item through a quote management
application;
• product order: user wants to place a product order item for a product offering; product
configuration guides the configuration of the product order item through an order entry
application;
• shopping cart: customer wants to place a shopping cart item for a product offering;
product configuration guides the configuration of the shopping cart item through an e-
commerce application;
• customer product/pricing discovery: a prospect customer is browsing the catalog and
wants to obtain a price estimate for a specific product offering configuration using a
digital engagement channel; the outcome of this scenario may be creation of a product
order/item or shopping cart/item.
Query a product configuration based on a partially configured
product configuration
A user is configuring a product offering from a quote, product order, shopping cart, or any
other digital engagement front-end. A user may also reconfigure existing cart/quote/product
order item. Configuring product offering includes (but is not limited to):


 • setting a characteristic value,
• selecting a bundled product offering,
• setting quantity of a bundled product offering,
• selecting a related product offering (e.g. add-on),
• setting quantity of a related offering,
• applying a promotion or discount.
On user interaction, the product configuration and pricing have to be recomputed following
product catalog and policy rules. Product configuration changes must also be reflected on
the UI layer.
Examples include:
• setting a characteristic value automatically sets a value of another characteristic,
• setting a characteristic value limits allowed values of another characteristic,
• setting a characteristic value enables or disables another characteristic,
• setting a characteristic value changes metadata of another characteristic (e.g. cardinality,
regEx, min/max value etc.),
• setting a characteristic value enables or disables a bundled product offering or bundled
product offering group,
• setting a characteristic value may impact pricing,
• setting a characteristic value may trigger an alarm in case of invalid product
configuration,
• selecting a bundled or related product offering may require presentation of additional
characteristics that require user input,
• selecting a bundled product offering may limit selection of another bundled product
offering considering groups, options, and min/max cardinality rules,
• selecting a bundled product offering may impact pricing,
• setting quantity of a bundled product offering may limit selection of another bundled
product offering considering groups, options, and min/max cardinality rules,


 • setting a bundled product offering quantity may impact pricing,
• setting bundled offering quantity may trigger an alarm in case of invalid product
configuration,
• selecting a promotion or discount may require price recalculation.
Product configuration is an interactive process where user performs UI actions and product
configurator executes logic that guides user experience layer to reflect these changes.
Engagement Management Web UI may be quote entry UI, order entry UI, e-commerce UI, or
any other digital customer engagement UI that CSP uses.
Query allowed actions for existing product instance
A customer has an existing product in the product inventory and wants to make a
modification. The product configuration API is used to query a list of allowed actions
(operations) on existing product instance. Each action may incur charges that have to be
calculated and presented to the customer.
Product configurator receives a product reference and other relevant contextual information
as input (e.g. channel, sales representative, etc.). Product configurator obtains details from
product inventory, product catalog management, and policy management and executes
product and policy rules to compute a list of allowed product actions (modifications) including
pricing.
Engagement management Web UI may be quote entry UI, order entry UI, e-commerce UI, or
any other digital customer engagement UI that CSP uses. The purpose of the diagram is to
present interactions between front-ends and the product configurator component.
Interactions between product configurator and other back-end APIs and intentionally omitted
for the sake of simplicity.
Query a product configuration for an existing product modification
A customer has an existing product in the product inventory. Product configurator has
already returned a list of allowed actions for the product. The customer chooses to make a
modification of an existing product instance by selecting an action from the list of allowed


 
actions. The product configurator is invoked to compute a corresponding product
configuration to make the modification.
Product configurator receives a product reference, an action (operation), and other relevant
contextual information as input (e.g. channel, sales representative, etc.). Product
configurator obtains details from product inventory, product catalog management, and policy
management and executes product and policy rules to create an appropriate product
configuration for product modification.
Configuring an existing product modification is an iterative and interactive process between
the front-end and product configurator. During the configuration process, the product
configuration may be recreated as described by the use case "Query a product configuration
based on a partially configured product configuration" to reflect user selection & input.
Check product configuration
A user has configured a product configuration for a new product purchase or an existing
product modification through any supported engagement management system (quote
management, order entry, shopping cart, selfcare portal, mobile app etc.).
User may be a CPS’s employee (e.g. sales representative) or end-customer.
Prior to proceeding, the user needs to validate the correctness of the product configuration.
During the validation (check) procedure, the checks that may be executed include (but are
not limited to):
• mandatory characteristic values are set,
• characteristic values are not in conflict with allow lists, regExps, min/max values,
• no conflict exists with characteristic metadata (e.g. cardinality),
• bundle product offering selection & quantities are not in conflict with groups and group
options,
• all required bundle product offerings are configured as a part of product configuration
structure,
• all required related product offerings are configured as a part or product configuration
structure,


 • policy rules execution returns no conflicts,
• no conflicting prices exist.
The result of check product configuration tells the client if the product configuration is valid or
not to be presented to the user. It may also propose an alternative validated product
configuration that may be presented to the user on the UI as a preview / confirm changes
screen.
Upon successful validation of product configuration, the user may continue with the product
ordering process by creating a product order (item) or shopping cart (item) in the Product
Order Capture & Validation ODA component (TMFC002).
Retrieve query product configuration
This use case supports the retrieval of the query product configuration task by ID.
List query product configuration
This use case supports listing of query product configuration tasks matching the input
criteria.
Delete query product configuration
This use case supports deleting a query product configuration task. On query product
configuration state change event a state change notification is created. The query product
configuration task is not completed but the partially computed result contains sufficient
information for the client. The client triggers a delete operation.
Retrieve check product configuration
This use case supports retrieval of the check product configuration task by ID.
List check product configuration
This use case supports listing of check product configuration tasks matching the input
criteria.
Delete check product configuration
This use case supports deleting a check product configuration task. On check product
configuration state change event a state change notification is created. The check product
configuration task is not completed but the partially computed result contains sufficient
information for the client. The client triggers a delete operation.


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
201

Design Guidelines.
