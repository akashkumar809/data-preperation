 Introduction
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Product Ordering
management. It includes the model definition as well as all available operations. Possible
actions are creating, updating and retrieving Product Orders. The specification covers also a
task-based resource to request Product Order Cancellation.
The Product Ordering API provides a standardized mechanism for placing a product order
with all of the necessary order parameters. The API consists of a simple set of operations
that interact with Customer Relationship Management / Order Negotiation systems in a
consistent manner. A product order is created based on a product offer that is defined in a
catalog. The product offer identifies the product or set of products that are available to a
customer, and includes characteristics such as pricing, product options and market. The
product order references the product offer and identifies any specific requests made by the
customer.
Product Ordering API manages product order resource:
• A Product Order is a type of order which can be used to place an order between a
customer and a service provider or between a service provider and a partner and vice
versa
• Main Product Order attributes are its identifier, state, priority, category (mass market,
enterprise, etc.), related dates (acknowledged, inProgress, completed…), related billing
account, related parties and order items
• Main Order Items (aka order lines) attributes are the ordered offering and product
characteristics with the related action to be performed (e.g. add or delete the products),
state, location information for delivery.
Product ordering API performs the following operations on Product Order:
• Creation of a product order (including default values and creation rules)
• Partial update of a product order (including updating rules)
• Retrieval of a product order or a collection of product orders depending on filter criteria
• Deletion of product order (for administration purposes)
• Notification of events on product order
◦Product Order creation
◦Product Order removal
◦Product Order state change
◦Product Order value change used to notify that any data in an order has just changed
◦Product Order information required used to notify that some data in the order need to
be filled / are missing
Product ordering API performs the following operations on CancelProductorder:
• Creation of a product order cancel request
• Retrieval of a product order cancellation request or a collection of product order


 cancellation requests depending on filter criteria
• Notification of events on product order
◦Cancel Product Order creation
◦Cancel Product Order state change
◦Order information required used to notify that some data in the cancel product order
need to be filled / are missing
The following assumptions were considered in the development of this document:
• The Order Management system has access to the commercial catalog system.
• The Order Management system has the capability to assess product order cancellation
request.
Product Order state lifecycle


 
A Product Order is a type of order which can be used to place an order between a customer
and a service provider or between a service provider and a partner.
State
Definition
Acknowledged
The Acknowledged state is where an order/item
has been received and has passed message and
basic business validations.
Rejected
The Rejected state is where: An order failed the
Order Feasibility check / Invalid information is
provided through the order request / The order
request fails to meet business rules for ordering
Same rules applied for order item.


 
State
Definition
Pending
The Pending state is used when an order/item is
currently in a waiting stage for an action/activity to
be completed before the order/item can progress
further, pending order amend or cancel
assessment. In situations where Access Seeker
action is required, an “information required”
notification will be issued on transition into this
state. A pending stage can lead into auto
cancellation of an order/item, if no action is taken
within the defined timeframes to be described
under the Agreement.
InProgress
The In Progress state is where an order Item has
passed the Order Feasibility check successfully
and product delivery has started. For the order at
least one order item is inProgress
Held
The Held state is used when an order/item cannot
be progressed due to an issue. SP has
temporarily delayed completing an order/item to
resolve an infrastructure shortfall to facilitate
supply of order. Upon resolution of the issue, the
order/item will continue to progress.
AssessingCancellation
Following a cancel request, the SP is assessing if
cancel can be done for the order/item (or if the
PO has reached PONR). If cancellation request is
not accepted after assessment the order will
return in Held or Pending or InProgress state.
PendingCancellation
Once a cancel order has been accepted by SP, it
could in some UC take time to effectively cancel
the order/item. During this time when accepted
cancellation is effectively processed we use
Pending Cancellation.
Cancelled
The Cancelled state is where an In-Flight
Order/item has been successfully cancelled.
Completed
The Completed state is where an item has
complete provision and the service is now active.
For an order all order item are completed
Failed
Order item as not a successful delivery
completion. The product is not delivered and the
order item failed. All Order items have failed
which results in the entire Order has Failed.
Partial
Some Order items have failed and some have
succeeded so the entire Order is in a Partial
state. This provides support for partial Failure of
an Order. This state is not available at item level
State engine comments:
• The choice to accept order is done for the complete order and we cannot have a partial
acceptance with some item in rejected and some other in acknowledged.


 • Consistence rules must be defined between order state & order item state (example: an
order has a failed state if it has all order item state with Completed or Failed status with
at least one Completed and one Failed)
Cancel Product Order state lifecycle
State
Definition
Acknowledged
The acknowledged state is where a cancellation
request has been received and has passed
message and basic business validations.
InProgress
The In Progress state is when the cancel request
is currently in the hands of the SP sales team to
assess customer cancel request.
TerminatedWithErrors
The Cancellation Request could not be correctly
completed by SP sales team. Cancel result is not
available.
Done
Cancellation request has been assessed and
result available.


 Sample Use Cases
Reader will find examples of use cases using this API in “IG1228 How to use ODA”
document.
To illustrate JSON representation of resources concerned by these APIs, we use the two use
cases detailed below.
Use case 1 (UC1): Acquisition
This use case illustrates the acquisition of a new mobile line featuring a mobile access, a
tariff plan and a coverage options.
Use case 2 (UC2): Modification
This use case illustrates a modification of the coverage option.


 


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 document.
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

Updates partially a ProductOrder
PATCH /productOrder/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a ProductOrder entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
201
