Executive Summary 
This document is an Addendum to the Business Process Framework, (GB921). It assists new readers and 
users of Business Process Framework by providing an introductory view of some of the concepts, goals, 
and structure of the Business Process Framework work. 
It should be read in conjunction with the main GB921 document, and other Addenda (see GB921 Concepts 
and Principles for details). 
 
 
 
 


1. 
What is the Business Process Framework? 
The Communications and Digital services industry is facing unprecedented churn and the struggle to 
remain profitable in the face of more competition, higher customer expectations, falling market share and 
growing price pressures. The industry has a need to clearly define and understand the business processes 
involved in order to tackle these issues. It also needs to reach a consensus on the common process view 
for equipment suppliers, applications builders and integrators to build management systems by combining 
third party and in-house developments. 
The Business Process Framework (also known as the eTOM) is an ongoing TM Forum initiative to deliver a 
business process model or framework for use by Communications and Digital services industry. The goal is 
to set a vision for the industry to enable it to compete successfully through the implementation of business 
process-driven approaches to managing the enterprise. This includes ensuring integration among all vital 
enterprise support systems concerned with service delivery and support. 
The focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the 
linkages between these processes, the identification of interfaces, and the use of customer, service, 
resource, supplier/partner and other information by multiple processes. The TM Forum Business Process 
Framework is a reference framework for categorizing all the business activities that a service provider will 
use, in a structured manner that allows these to be addressed at various levels of detail. For such 
companies, it serves as the blueprint for process direction and provides a neutral reference point for 
internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with other 
providers. For suppliers, the Business Process Framework outlines potential boundaries of software 
components to align with the customers' needs and highlights the required functions, inputs, and outputs 
that must be supported by products.  
A particular strength of the Business Process Framework is that as a foundation  core element in the former 
Frameworx program , it provided a foundation along with other works underway in the Open Digital 
Framework (ODF) program, namely the evolution of the Information Framework, the Application 
Framework along with Open APIs, along with ODA and other TM Forum leading programs. 
So, the Business Process Framework defines a business-oriented view of the enterprise. This view is useful 
for planners, managers, strategists, etc., who need to view the enterprise in business terms, without 
immediate concern for the nature of the way that these business needs are organized or automated within 
the business. Therefore, the Business Process Framework emphasizes issues such as process structure, 
process components, process interactivity and the business roles and responsibilities to which these relate. 
In defining these aspects, the Business Process Framework also provides a basis for setting requirements 
for system solutions, technical architectures, technology choices and implementation paths, but it is 
neutral towards the particular way that these requirements are met. 
Thus, the Business Process Framework can be considered to have two faces: one oriented towards the 
business, customer, products, etc., and one towards solutions, systems and implementations supporting 
the business. 
 
 


 
It should be recognized that through the TM Forum work, the Business Process Framework represents an 
industry-consensus on the Service Provider processes, which has been harmonized across the global scene 
and is based on Member contributions. It is allowable, and indeed expected, that this will mean that the 
Business Process Framework must be tailored and/or extended for use within an individual company. In 
particular, the Business Process Framework does not seek to constrain the way that the processes fit into 
a specific organization. An advantage of this positioning of the Business Process Framework as a 
framework, rather than a directly-implemented specification, is that differentiation amongst the Business 
Process Framework users is not restricted, which is vital to allow specialization and competition. In addition, 
as already mentioned, the Business Process Framework does not fix upon particular routes to 
implementation and is thus valid in many different environments with varying levels of automation, 
technology, etc. 
So, the Business Process Framework is a framework, not a final implementation specification. It will 
typically be customized and extended by users for their own business needs but provides a vital common 
reference that is industry recognized and represents de-facto, and now through ITU-T an official standard 
within and between companies on business process definition. 


2. Where did the Business Process Framework 
come from? 
Work on business process modeling by the TM Forum (formerly the TeleManagement Forum and the 
Network Management Forum before then) began in the early 1990’s with the Service Management 
Automation and Reengineering Team (SMART) that gathered worldwide Service Provider views and 
distilled an initial Business Process Model. This work grew in the Telecom Operations Map (TOM) 
during the mid-90’s leading to the stabilization and publication of TOM in its final form towards the 
end of that decade. 
The TOM work gained wide industry support, but the scope of the TOM model did not cover the whole 
of the SP enterprise and only focused on the main Operations processes embodying the traditional 
telecoms activities around Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing (FAB). Increasingly, the complexities of 
interworking in the deregulated, competitive telecoms market required a complete enterprise view, 
and new business demands triggered by the internet and electronic commerce generally, led to a move 
to expand TOM to address this wider perspective. 
Thus, eTOM – for enhanced TOM – was initiated as a work program led by TM Forum as we entered 
the new Millennium. Initial releases of eTOM were provided to TM Forum members during 2001, and 
then a TM Forum Approved version of eTOM – GB921 v3.0 – was released in mid-2002. This was 
welcomed and adopted widely, and so further work to cement agreements, incorporate industry 
feedback, and extend the level of detail described resulted in further intermediate versions and then 
a new TM Forum Approved version early in 2004. This version – GB921 v4.0 – was also submitted under 
a liaison agreement to the ITU-T, which acts as the premier world-wide body with a remit under the 
United Nations for setting international Recommendations in the telecommunications sphere. This 
eTOM version was adopted by ITU-T in toto and has been published in parallel as their formal 
Recommendation M.3050, with exact alignment on the content with TM Forum’s GB921 v4.0. 
In 2009 due to the converging of the Information, Communications and Digital Media industries into 
what is now considered the Digital Services industry and the widening use of the eTOM, the TM Forum 
decided to rebrand the eTOM to the Business Process Framework. It was felt this would remove any 
artificial concerns about using the eTOM in non-telecommunications environments and broaden the 
uptake and adoption of the Business Process Framework (eTOM). 
Throughout this history, the Business Process Framework work has benefited from wide involvement 
from the global telecommunications industry, as well as academia, government agencies, etc. As it has 
evolved, the core has shown it can stand the test of time, and it is now regarded as the pre-eminent 
vehicle for expressing and discussing business processes in and around the Service Provider domain. 
The work continues, with an increasing emphasis now that the Business Process Framework has 
established a clear and agreed view of the business process framework itself, on applications of the 
Business Process Framework and guidance to prospective and existing users on how to gain maximum 
benefit from the Business Process Framework in their own businesses. 


3. How does the Business Process Framework 
work? 
3.1 Domain definition 
Since an earlier release of the Business Process Framework (Rel. 14.5), the collaboration team 
decided to formalize and generalize the notion of domains, in place of the previously existing level 0 
horizontal process groupings. This allowed us to ensure consistency and sound alignment with the 
other components of the Frameworx brand (namely SID and TAM). The 7 domains that were 
recognized (see figure below) were: 
1. Market & Sales domain 
2. Customer domain 
3. Product domain 
4. Service Domain 
5. Resource Domain 
6. Business Partner domain 
7. Enterprise domain 
3.2 Process Decompositions 
Process decomposition is a structured approach to analysis of a business through consideration of 
the enterprise’s business processes and their internal structure. The basis of the concept is illustrated 
in Figure 1-1 below. Here we see a representative process element, Process X, which might provide 
a specific area of capability within an enterprise – say, handling of customer orders, for example. 
When analyzed, it is decided that the contained functionality, behavior, etc. associated with that 
process can/should be sub-divided into three lower-level process elements. Note that typically such 
a “decomposition” is partly evident from the analysis of the detail captured within the process 
concerned, and partly is the result of design decisions, where judgment is used to make the most 
appropriate partitioning for the situation under consideration. 
 
 


 
 
Figure 1-1: Process Decomposition 
 
Each of the decomposed processes, X1, X2 and X3 can be further decomposed – X2 is shown as 
decomposed into X21 and X22 – and this can be continued – X21 is shown as decomposed into X211 
and X212. Note that not all “branches” of the decomposition “tree” necessarily led to “leaves” (i.e., 
final process elements) at the same level of decomposition. This will depend on the scope and 
content of the processes involved. 
The process decomposition approach has these general characteristics: 
• 
It defines components of a process that perform part of that process 
• 
It provides insight into the structure and content of process areas (or groupings) 
• 
It reveals finer detail at lower levels, as decomposition proceeds 
• 
It can be continued to as many sub-levels as are needed 
• 
The aim is to provide a complete analysis of the process under decomposition - i.e., the 
sum of the components equals the totality of the original process 
• 
It represents a static perspective of process 
• 
It does not mandate any flow relationship between the process elements 
Note that the process elements derived through process decomposition may be applied in various 
ways within process flows. There may be many process flows (representing, say, enterprise-specific 
applications) that can be built using the common set of process elements specified within the 
Business Process Framework. There is further discussion on process flows later in this section, 
including the process flow diagrams that arise and are used in this work. 
The process decomposition for the Business Process Framework (see Figure 1-2) begins at the 
Enterprise level and defines business processes in a series of groupings. The Business Process 
Framework uses hierarchical decomposition to structure the business processes according to which 
all of the processes of the enterprise are successively decomposed. Process descriptions, inputs and 
outputs, as well as other key elements are defined. The Business Process Framework represents the 
whole of a service provider’s enterprise environment. The Framework is defined as generically as 
possible so that it is organization, technology, and service independent. At the overall conceptual 
level, the Business Process Framework can be viewed as having the following two major process 
areas: 
 
 
Process X
-
Process Element 
X1
-
Process Element 
X3
-
Process Element 
X2
-
Process Element 
X21
-
Process Element 
X22
-
Process Element 
X211
-
Process Element 
X212


 
Strategy to Readiness covering planning, capability delivery and lifecycle management 
Operations covering the core of operational management 
Figure 1-2: Business Process Framework (eTOM) 
 
The Business Process Framework (see Figure 1-2) shows seven context verticals. These verticals 
were originally created to represent the various stages that participate in the life cycle of the 
enterprise from Strategy to Operations; they help classify and qualify processes when decomposing 
and structuring the Business Process Framework. They are part of the business process map as they 
represent a set of contextual boundaries for level 2 core processes. Amongst these context verticals 
(or vertical process groupings as they were previously known), the right side of the Framework 
represents the Operations process area, which is a collection of operations-centric processes 
covering Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing & Revenue Management (aka FAB). 
Operations Readiness & Support (OR&S) is differentiated from FAB processes to highlight the focus 
on enabling support and automation in FAB, i.e., on-line and immediate support of customers, with 
OR&S ensuring that the operational environment is in place to ensure the FAB processes are able 
to operate optimally. Outside of the Operations process area - in the Strategy to Readiness (S2R) 
process area - the Strategy Management vertical, as well as the Capability Delivery and Lifecycle 
Management verticals, are differentiated. These are distinct because, unlike Operations, they do 
not directly support the customer, and are intrinsically different from the Operations processes. 
With the evolution of the business the sense of time has been compressed with increasing 
automation, and what used to be short term processes are becoming increasingly closer to real 
time. 
 
 


The Framework also depicts cross-functional domains as they span horizontally across an 
enterprise’s internal organization. The horizontal cross-functional process groupings (referred to as 
domains) in Figure 1-2 distinguish strategy-centric, development-centric processes from 
operations-centric processes, e.g., Marketing versus Selling, Customer Strategy versus Customer 
Support, Service Development versus Service Configuration, etc. Amongst these horizontal 
domains, those on the left (that cross the Strategy Management, Capability Delivery and Lifecycle 
Management verticals provide the strategy, implement the infrastructure, and define the work in 
the Operations process area. 
The Business Process Framework Model graphically illustrates the business processes required for 
operating service provider enterprises. It lays out these processes first from a high-level 
perspective, and then drills down to increasingly detailed levels of understanding. The Business 
Process Framework describes in text what the model describes graphically. 
 
 
Figure 1-3 : The Business Process Framework Operations (OPS) Processes 
 
 


The Business Process Framework is structured in two main process areas: Operations (OPS) and 
Strategy to Readiness (S2R). Each process area consists of more detailed process components and 
decomposition at levels 1, 2, 3, etc. This hierarchical decomposition enables detail to be defined in a 
structured way and also allows the Business Process Framework to be adopted at varying levels 
and/or for different processes. Each process element has a process ID which indicates the process 
level and degree of detail revealed at that level - the more digits in the process ID, the more granular 
detail in the process is available. 
Operations (OPS - see Figure 1-3) is the heart of the Business Process Framework and much of the 
original TOM work has carried through into OPS (the GB921 documentation provides some insight 
into the relationship between the TOM and the eTOM). The “FAB” processes (Fulfillment, Assurance, 
Billing & Revenue Management) provide the core of the Operations area, the horizontal domains 
(Level 1) namely Market & Sales, Customer, Product, Service, Resource, Business Partner and 
Enterprise) provide the context for the definition of activity flows. 
OR&S (Operations Readiness & Support) has been separated from FAB originally to reflect the 
separation between “front-office”, “Customer-supporting” real-time operations (in FAB) from “back-
office” near real-time support processes. This split may not apply in some organizations (in which 
case, the OR&S and FAB processes may be merged) but it is necessary to keep the separation to 
distinguish their purpose and lifecycle footprint. 
 


 
In Figure 1-4, the OPS area is shown with Level 2 (core) processes visible. Note that a Level 2 process 
is part of a horizontal domain and typically positioned within one vertical, however, in some cases, a 
Level 2 process can span across several context verticals (e.g., Resource Data Collection and 
Distribution). This is because such process belongs to more than one vertical context (e.g., for 
Resource Data Collection & Distribution), the data collected from the network elements may 
represent usage data for Billing & Revenue Management but may also support fault handling or 
performance assessment in Assurance). 
 
Figure 1-5 :  An example of Level 3 Operations (OPS) Processes 
 
This mechanism of decomposition can be extended as required. Figure 1-5 depicts an example of 
Level 3 process elements within a Level 2 process element – Resource Provisioning. Full descriptions 
of decompositions to Level 3 for this and other processes are included in the GB921 documentation. 
 
Figure 1-6: The Business Process Framework Strategy to Readiness (S2R) Processes 


 
 
Strategy to Readiness (S2R – see Figure 1-6) has a similar structure to OPS with corresponding vertical 
and horizontal process groupings. In the verticals, Strategy Management covers the processes 
involved in developing the enterprise strategy and gaining commitment from the sponsoring 
organization for this purpose. Capability Delivery covers design and implementation of all 
foundational capabilities, including technology and infrastructure needed –network and IT 
infrastructure is probably the most obvious, but also human resources are part of the scope. 
Lifecycle Management covers the lifecycle of products, services, resources and business partners– 
note that the Business Process Framework distinguishes Product (as exposed and sold to Customers) 
from Service (used internally to represent the “technical” part of the product, i.e., excluding 
commercial aspects such as tariffing, T&Cs, support, etc.) and Resource (physical and non-physical 
components used to support the service). 
 
Figure 1-7:  Level 2 Strategy to Readiness (S2R) Processes 
 
In Figure 1-7, the S2R area is shown with Level 2 processes visible. As with OPS, domains are 
positioned on a vertical process grouping. 
 


 
 
Figure 1-8:  The Business Process Framework Enterprise Domain Processes 
The Enterprise Domain (see Figure 1-8) shown above as a hierarchical diagram is typically 
represented in this view in most process modeling tools supporting the Business Process Framework. 
The top box is the Enterprise Domain itself (Level 1), the horizontal rows below show Level 2 
processes elements. 
3.3 Process Flows 
Process decompositions provide an essential insight into the process definition and content. To 
understand further how processes behave, process flows can be developed that examine how some 
or all of the processes support some larger, “end-to-end” or “through” process view across the 
enterprise. Such process flows are not constrained to bridge across the entire enterprise – they can 
have any scope that is considered meaningful and helpful to analyze - but such process flows may 
also involve a broader area of the enterprise as depicted in specific Business Process Framework 
documentation (e.g., GB921E). Process flows describe specific scenarios to achieve a specific 
business purpose. 
Figure 1-9 shows a portion of a simple process flow, where several Business Process Framework 
Level 2 OPS processes can be recognized, the linkages between these indicate the nature of the 
activity. Note that here, as well as in other diagrams in this section, the flows are examples from 
previous work from an older version of the Process Framework, but the approach and design 
principles, rather than the specificity of the flows illustrated is what the focus is on. 
In the following example, a portion of the handling of a customer order is shown. 


 
Figure 1-9:  Process Flow (partial example only) 
 
The process flow design has these general characteristics: 
• 
It analyzes a typical (specific) scenario 
• 
It provides insight into the behavior and interaction amongst processes 
• 
It chooses to model the flow at an appropriate level of process detail 
• 
It can use process decompositions to enhance/refine detail 
• 
The aim is to provide only an example of the process flows - i.e., only some of the possible 
interactions are described in each scenario 
• 
Thus, it typically provides a partial view of process behavior (because flows are based on 
specific scenarios)  
• 
It represents a dynamic perspective of processes. 
 
In applying this approach for Business Process Framework process flows, it has been found that several 
different flow-related diagram types have proved useful, considering the variety of interests (business and 
technical, high level and detailed design) that needs to be addressed. 
This is initially a general positioning type of diagram that provides limited insight into the flow but helps focus 
on the contextual part of the Business Process Framework involved. 


 
Figure 1-10:  General Interaction Diagram for Production Order to Acceptance 
 
Figure 1-10 shows an example of this diagram - a general process interaction diagram – for a scenario based 
around Production Order to Acceptance in the Fulfillment vertical that is covered in the GB921E 
documentation. This shows some of the process interactions that arise for this scenario but does not give any 
detailed insight at this level into the behavior. It is still useful for a high-level view, though. 
 
Figure 1-11:  Process Interaction Flow Diagram for Production Order to Acceptance 
 
The next diagram type, shown in Figure 1-11, is developed directly from a process analysis and 
modeling tool (rather than a general drawing software). Here the scope is with Level 2 process 
elements, but other Levels can be used depending on the detail required. This diagram type positions 
the processes in relatively the same way as in their representation on the Business Process 
Framework model diagrams, which helps avoid confusion. Each process only appears once, and so 
sequencing of the interactions is not explicit in this diagram (shown on process dynamics diagrams 
later). 


Swim lanes  are an important element in this type of workflow diagram. These are functional lanes 
of partitions of the process flow, which depict typically where the responsibility lies in those process 
elements with respect to the overall process flow (each swim-lane represents a line of responsibility 
for the tasks involved in such lane). In this example, the swim lanes have been drawn to represent 
the four horizontal functional process groupings of the Operations area of the Process Framework, 
since the scenario involved is focused on the Operations domain. In this arrangement, all the process 
elements in a specific swim lane in the diagram are components of that horizontal functional process 
grouping. It should be noted that swim lanes (despite their name) need not be only horizontal, 
although this is a common choice for clarity, and is the approach used in the Business Process 
Framework process flow diagrams. 
The process flow in Figure 1-11 addresses the Production Order to Acceptance stage of Fulfillment 
(other phases are documented in separate diagrams, for convenience). It begins with the Service 
Configuration & Activation process. Note that interactions between processes are events and are 
not intrinsically information transfers. Thus, they can be considered to represent transfer of control.  
 
 
Figure 1-12:  Process Interaction Flow Diagram for Trouble Ticket-to-Solution (Assurance) 
 
Figure 1-12 is another example of this diagram type, for the Trouble Ticketing process part of 
Assurance. It begins with the generation of a trouble ticket request or event, and then tracks the 
execution flow through Service Problem Management, Resource Trouble Management and the 
Business Partner domain which may actually be involved in the delivery of the service to the 
customer. 
However, even though interactions are labeled in these diagrams, sequencing and dependencies in 
the flow are still not explicit. For this, a different kind of diagram is needed. 


 
Figure 1-13:  Process Dynamics Flow Diagram for Trouble Ticket-to-Solution (Assurance) 
 
Figure 1-13 represents a process flow diagram, showing explicitly the dynamics of the process . Each 
process typically appears several times, each time providing a specific step in the process flow 
sequence. As different functionality comes into play on each appearance, this diagram can provide 
insight into the decomposition of the Level 2 process into more granular processes. It shows similar 
information as the Trouble Ticketing process interaction diagram of Figure 1-12, but it is more 
elaborate and provides a broader basis for further design. 
Developing process flows in this way is a valuable source of insight and additional detail to validate 
process decompositions, and to address specific areas of business priority for the use of the Business 
Process Framework. 
The adoption of the Process Framework in no way precludes the adoption of specific best practice 
workflows such as those available in ITIL® which provides workflow designs according to global IT 
Service Management standards along with suggested best practices. The value of the Business 
Process Framework is therefore in delivering reusable, well defined, process components. 


4. Why use the Business Process Framework? 
• 
The Framework provides a standard structure, terminology and classification scheme for 
describing business processes and their constituent building blocks. 
• 
The Framework supplies a foundation for applying enterprise-wide discipline to the 
development of business processes. 
• 
The Framework provides a basis for understanding and managing portfolios of IT applications 
in terms of business process requirements. 
• 
The Framework enables creation of consistent and high-quality end-to-end process flows, 
with opportunities for cost and performance improvement, and for re-use of existing 
processes and systems. 
• 
The deployment and adoption of the Framework across the industry increases the likelihood 
that standard, interoperable, application components will be integration-ready at a lower cost 
than traditional off-the-shelf or custom-built applications. 


5. When can the Business Process Framework 
help? 
The Business Process Framework can be adopted and used as a tool for analyzing your organization’s 
existing processes and for developing new processes. Different processes delivering the same business 
functionality can be identified, duplication eliminated, gaps revealed, new process design expedited, 
and variance reduced. The Business Process Framework can prove helpful in assessing the value, cost 
and performance of individual processes within your organization. 
 
The Business Process Framework can facilitate communication and interactions with suppliers and 
business partners by identifying and categorizing the processes that are relevant for such interactions. 
In a similar manner, the Business Process Framework can facilitate the identification of important 
customer relationship processes and evaluate whether they are functioning as required to meet 
customer expectations. 
 


6. Who is using the Business Process Framework? 
A natural question that arises is where and how the Business Process Framework is being used 
across the industry and how it is benefiting organizations involved. It is difficult to collect very 
detailed information about the use and benefits derived from its adoption across the industry, this 
is due to confidentiality concerns and sensitivity on strategic approach and direction; however, 
several major organizations have disclosed their position on this matter publicly, and the general 
interest and adoption of the Business Process Framework has been quite significant over the years 
and the perception is that the trend is still growing. 
 
The two main groups of Business Process Framework users are (1) Service Providers and (2) 
Vendors, System Integrators, etc. It is worth noting that it is estimated that there is a much larger 
number of organizations applying the Process Framework in their businesses, and also a large 
number of organizations using the Process Framework, who are either not actively involved with 
the TM Forum, or even unknown to the Forum. 
 
A vital source of insight on users and projects linked with the TM Forum work and related assets 
is the growing number of available case studies outlining how individual companies have applied 
the framework. Many of these relate to the Business Process Framework (often using the “eTOM” 
acronym); some of the case studies can be viewed through the following link: 
 
http://www.tmforum.org/CaseStudies 
 
Another important source is the presentations made at conference events such as Digital 
Transformation World (see http://www.tmforum.org/Conferences) 
 
Another aspect of Business Process Framework adoption is through other industry bodies that are 
operating in, or have influence on, the area. For example, the Business Process Framework has 
been endorsed by ITU-T. This represents a major achievement and establishes the Business 
Process Framework (eTOM), which has grown already to become a de facto standard, as a formal 
standard Recommendation (identified as M.3050) through ITU-T with its mandate under the 
United Nations. 
 
 


7. Some Ideas on Using the Business Process 
Framework 
Service Providers 
1. Assign your technical personnel to review the Business Process Framework and Model, and 
to present recommendations on adopting it for your enterprise (see www.tmforum.org for 
download advice). 
2. Encourage your vendors to understand the Business Process Framework, and. to describe 
their software applications in relation to the Business Process Framework. 
3. If you want your company’s view incorporated in future versions of the Business Process 
Framework, send a representative to participate actively in its ongoing development. 
Vendors 
1. Provide references on your software products for customers using the Business Process 
Framework structure and concepts. 
2. Assist your customers’ understanding of your software products by explaining your software 
products in relation to the Business Process Framework. 
3. Use the Business Process Framework as a guide to help generate product gap analysis, market 
analysis, competitive analysis, etc. 
4. Establish and build partnerships to produce more complete solutions for service providers. 
5. Leverage the Business process framework to deliver reusable, and thus more affordable, 
solutions and products based on other best practices such as ITIL®, TOGAF®, COBIT® and others. 
6. To ensure the Business Process Framework accurately reflects how the telecom business 
operates, send a representative to participate in its ongoing development.

Bringing the Business Process Framework into your Business – Some hints and Suggestions 
To evaluate and use the Business Process Framework for your own business, it is essential that the 
ground is prepared so that the goals are clear, and it is possible to assess the impact of this. 
As a first step, it is important to gain internal commitment and sponsor support for the adoption of 
the Business Process Framework, since the kind of business process analysis, and possible changes 
that will result, need buy-in and active participation from those involved. A critical success factor is 
obtaining senior management recognition and support. 
It is also critical to identify and assess the area(s) where the Process Framework may bring benefit, 
and to define success criteria for any trial or pilot use, so that results can be leveraged to build 
confidence and justify further work. 
In using the Business Process Framework, it is important to recognize that it provides a ready-made 
generic business process framework, which may need adapting for your business, and that it is 
progressively being further developed to lower-level detail. 
The Business Process Framework can be used directly: 
• 
to assist your business partitioning (Process groupings and definitions to define 
roles and responsibilities within your organization) 
• 
to procure solutions from vendors that identify which processes within the 
P
F
k
b i
t d


• 
to bring economies of scale 
• 
to reduce product development cycles 
• 
To facilitate process customization and extension 
Furthermore, the Process Framework can be adapted and extended to accommodate 
specific needs in your own area: 
• 
use the Process Framework as a baseline 
• 
define additional detail and extensions in areas specific to your business 
• 
influence ongoing Business Process Framework development work through 
direct participation 
o share ideas and gain insight 
o ensure the Process Framework evolves in line with your needs 
o maximize the relevance of industry products 
In extending and customizing the Business Process Framework, a number of strategies can 
be considered: 
Bottom-up 
o Start with your enterprise existing Business Processes definitions 
o Map existing Business Process flows back to the Business Process 
Framework 
o Construct your own decomposition of the Business Process 
Framework published Business Processes  
Top down 
o Decompose the Business Process Framework processes into more 
granular processes, to expose more detail 
o Define process flows, to link processes together 
o Combine decompositions and flows, to describe fully the behavior of 
each process area 
o Continue (as required) to lower levels of detail 
The approach used can be adjusted as convenient in each case. Experience shows there is value in 
firming up agreement at a given level of decomposition and analysis, before proceeding to develop 
fully the next level of detail (of course, it may be helpful to “look ahead” a little to ensure that the 
current level of detail is resilient).
