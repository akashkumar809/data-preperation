TMFC037 Service Performance Management will 
collect, monitor, analyze and report on 
the end-end service performance. This can 
include a real-time, end-to-end view to 
ensure that each service is functioning 
correctly as well as a historical view. These 
functions build on the Resource 
Performance Management data and active 
end-end service performance test data to 
provide a view of the service. The 
component provides a key input to determine 
the Quality of Service.

<Note to not be inserted onto ODA Component specifications: If a new ABE is 
required, but it does not yet exist in SID. Then you should include a textual description 
of the new ABE, and it should be clearly noted that this ABE does not yet exist. In 
addition a Jira epic should be raised to request the new ABE is added to SID, and the 
SID team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the 
component without this ABE. If the ABE is critical then the component specification 
should not be published until the ABE issue has been resolved. Alternatively if the ABE 
is not critical, then the specification could continue to publication. The result of this 
decision should be clearly recorded.>

Service Performance 
Reporting provides the

required to generate reports 
about the performance of the 
service provider's 
services. These reports may 
be generated as part of the 
normal periodic operations 
("scheduled"), or may be as a 
result of a specific analysis 
request ("in-
demand").  Report types 
include near real time, 
historical view, and 
trend analysis. Relevant 
performance reports are also 
provided to service/network 
planning to perform network 
updates.

3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events 
 
The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component.  
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs.  
• 
List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may 
consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each 
defined event. 
 
<Note note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is 
required, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the 
new Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In 
addition, a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the 
Open API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of 
the component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component 
specification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. 
Alternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to 
publication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.>
