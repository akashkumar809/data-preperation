Inventory items. It is also responsible for RFS 
(Resource Facing Service) definition, mapping 
between CFS and RFS and mapping with 
infrastructure/network resources. 
Service Inventory component has functionality 
that enables inventory items creation, inventory 
organization, inventory search or filter, 
inventory monitoring and tracking, inventory 
control and inventory auditing. 
The minimum check to be performed at 
inventory items creation or update is the global 
consistency with related Service Catalog

3. TMF OPEN APIs & Events 
The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component.  
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs. 
• 
List of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate are listed in this section along with a list of the events which it 
may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for 
each defined event.

• 
 ISA-416 - Harmonize functions related to Product, Service and Resource 
Inventories  BACKLOG Harmonize as much as possible functions related to 
Product, Service and Resource Inventory  (this is under review)  
• 
 ISA-996 - Master Data Management has repurposed catalog related 
functions  BACKLOG  
As part of reviewing the Product, Service and Resource Catalogs to align with the 
updates to the Functional Framework, we realized that a lot of functions have either 
been removed or been re-purposed by Master Data Management.  
Due to this, we had to make a decision to remove all these functions from the 
Components:  
• 
Removed deleted unclassified functions  (1,2,5,7,9,10, 12,14,15) 
• 
Removed functions that used to be related to Catalog management but now 
have been re-purposed by Master Data Management ((3,4, 6,11,13) 
Our concern is that we may be missing functions for the catalog due to re-use of 
Master Data Management.
