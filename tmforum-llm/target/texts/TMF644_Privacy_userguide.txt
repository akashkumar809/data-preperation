 Introduction
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Privacy management. It
includes the model definition as well as all available operations. The following document is
the specification of the REST API for Privacy management. It includes the model definition
as well as all available operations.
The Privacy management API provides standardized mechanism for privacy profile
specification, privacy profiles and privacy agreements such as creation, update, retrieval,
deletion and notification of events.
Privacy management API manages the following data resources:
Privacy Profile Specification
• Privacy profile specification represents a description for privacy profiles.
• Main privacy profile specification attributes are its identifier, name, description, version,
last update, lifecycle status, validity period, characteristics and their values, related
parties, applicable roles.
Privacy Profile
• Privacy profile represents the set of Privacy settings defined for a Party
• Main privacy profile attributes are its identifier, name, description, date of creation, status,
validity period, privacy profile specification, characteristics values, agreement, the party
who has agreed and the party which the privacy is applicable for, typically the same party
represents both the aggreged by and applicable for. In case of minor privacy the
applicable for party is the minor and the agreed party is the parent.
Privacy Agreement
• Privacy agreement represents the approval made by the Party about a Party Privacy
Profile
• Main privacy agreement attributes are its identifier, name, description, agreement period,
initial date, completion date, document number, statement of intent, status, type, version,
agreement specification, agreement items, engaged party, agreement authorization,
characteristics, associated agreements, privacy profile and privacy profile characteristic
values.
Privacy management API performs the following operations on privacy profile specification,
privacy profiles and privacy agreements:
• Retrieval of a privacy profile specification, a privacy profile or a privacy agreement, or of
a collection of them depending on filter criteria
• Partial update of a privacy profile specification, a privacy profile or a privacy agreement
• Creation of a privacy profile specification, a privacy profile or a privacy agreement
• Deletion of a privacy profile specification, a privacy profile or a privacy agreement (for
administration purposes)


 • Notification of events:
◦privacy profile specification create
◦privacy profile specification update
◦privacy profile specification delete
◦privacy profile create
◦privacy profile update
◦privacy profile delete
◦privacy agreement create
◦privacy agreement update
◦privacy agreement delete

PartyPrivacyAgreemennt Life Cycle


 
PartyPrivacyProfile Life Cycle
PartyPrivacyProfileSpecification Life Cycle


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections 
occurs 
when 
entities 
inherit 
from 
base 
entities, 
for 
instance 
a
IndividualPrivacyProfile 
and 
EmployeePrivacyProfile 
inheriting 
properties 
from 
the
PartyPrivacyProfile entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of PartyPrivacyProfile instances some may be instances of
IndividualPrivacyProfile where other could be instances of EmployeePrivacyProfile. The
@type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type
attributes that can be provided when this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an
PartyPrivacyProfileRef object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class.
Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the
reference itself, such as IndividualPrivacyProfileRef or EmployeePrivacyProfileRef, and not
the class type of the referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-
classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

PartyPrivacyProfileSpecification resource
Party Privacy Profile Specification serves as a template for creating Privacy Profiles. The
specification defines characteristics for the profile. For example there might be a profile
specification for residential customers, and a different specification for partners.

This operation allows partial updates of a PartyPrivacyProfile entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

Description
This operation allows partial updates of a PartyPrivacyProfileSpecification entity. Support of

is 
mandatory, 
support 
of 
json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Usage samples
Here's an example of a request to delete party privacy profile specification
Request
DELETE /partyPrivacyProfileSpecification/103
Content-Type: application/json

 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
201
