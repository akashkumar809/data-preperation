 Introduction
The following document is the specification of the REST API for ProductOfferingQualification
management. It includes the model definition as well as all available operations. In the Open
Digital Economy where multiple actors (SDPs, CSPs, …) may be involved with the delivery
of an end-to end service, those actors need to collaborate and interact with the customer as
needed. Following diagram shows ProductOfferingQualification API within pre-ordering API
package :
ProductOfferingQualification API is one of Pre-Ordering Management API Family. The
Product Offering Qualification API provides a standardized mechanism for placing a
qualification request to check offer commercial eligibility with all of the necessary
parameters. The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with Catalog and
Inventory systems in a consistent manner. A Product Offering Qualification is created based
on a product offers that are defined in a catalog. Product Offering Qualification API is one of
Pre-Ordering Management API Family. Product Offering Qualification API goal is to provide
Product Offering commercial eligibility, with 2 resources :
• CheckProductOfferingQualification
• QueryProductOfferingQualification
CheckProductOfferingQualification allows to :
• request a specific productOffering (of an array of productOffering) eligibility as an input a
configured customer context. The requester will provide an array of product offering
qualification item and expect to have a qualification result for each one of them.
• in the request, the following attributes could/must be filled :
◦relatedParty, for which the qualification must be done
◦place,(where the customer wants his productOffering)


 
◦channel, (sale channel of the current interaction where to make the qualification)
◦expected activation date.
• In the response, the API will provide qualification result but also :
◦Eligibility result reason (if any)
◦Alternate product offering proposal (if any).
QueryProductOfferingQualification allows to :
• look for productOffering eligible (or not) from a product category
• look for productOffering eligible (or not) from a productSpec description.
• in the request, the following attributes could/must be filled : productOffering, or
productSpec, or productCategory will be indicated (at least one is mandatory)
Because the API allows describing product from the inventory, it is also possible to use it to
retrieve productOffering available to complete existing product.
ProductOfferingQualification API could be used… … Before Shopping Cart or ProductOrder
API … After recommendation API to filtering result(s).
Product Offering Qualification API performs the following operations on Product Offering
Qualification :
• Retrieval of a Product Offering Qualification or a collection of Product Offering
Qualification depending on filter criteria
• Partial update of a Product Offering Qualification
• Creation of a Product Offering Qualification
• Deletion of Product Offering Qualification (for administration purposes)
• Notification of events on Product Offering Qualification
◦Product Offering Qualification creation
◦Product Offering Qualification removal
◦Product Offering Qualification state change
◦Product Offering Qualification value change used to notify that any data in a Product
Offering Qualification has just changed
The following Assumptions were considered in the development of this document :
• The Product Offering Qualification management system has access to the commercial
catalog system
Lifecycle
The state machine specifying the typical state change transitions is provided below. This is
standard task based resource lifecycle:


 
State
Definition
InProgress
The In Progress state is when the POQ is currently in the hands of the
SP sales team to assess customer qualification request. Everything
should be updatable in this state.
Acknowledged
The acknowledged state is where a POQ request has been received
and has passed message and basic business validations.
TerminatedWithError
The CPOQ or QPOQ could not be correctly completed by SP sales
team. Qualification is not available or partial.
Done
Qualification has been done. The POQ is ready for client.


 Sample Use Cases
Reader will find example of use cases using Usage API in “Open Digital Business Scenarios
and Use Cases” document.
For QueryProductOfferingQualification :
• Perform a request for a broadband offer on the Web channel for a specific geographic
location. The product offering qualification resust is qualified
For CheckProductOfferingQualification :
• Perform a request for an new eLine on an existing UNI. The product offering qualification
result is alternate – requested eLine capabilities are not available but alternate
configuration is available.
• Retrieve the list of productOfferingQualification with result qualified.


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 document.
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.


 RESOURCE MODEL
ProductOfferingQualification is used to perform a commercial eligibility. It allows to retrieve a
list of productOffering that are commercially available in the context of the interaction
(defined be place, channel, party, product).
Managed Entity and Task Resource Models
CheckProductOfferingQualification resource
CheckProductOfferingQualification is used to perform a commercial eligibility. It allows to
request an eligibility check for a list of productOfferings (one per item). The response will
provide qualification result depending on catalog rules and of the context of the interaction
(defined be place, channel, party, product).

Updates partially a CheckProductOfferingQualification
PATCH /checkProductOfferingQualification/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a CheckProductOfferingQualification entity. Support
of json/merge (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Description
This operation allows partial updates of a QueryProductOfferingQualification entity. Support
of json/merge (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Deletes a QueryProductOfferingQualification
DELETE /queryProductOfferingQualification/{id}
Description
This operation deletes a QueryProductOfferingQualification entity.


 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
201
