Introduction 
 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for customer quote management. It includes the model 
definition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are creating, updating and retrieving customer quotes.  
The customer Quote API provides a standardized mechanism for placing a customer quote with all of the necessary 
quote parameters. The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with CRM/Order Negotiation systems 
in a consistent manner. A customer quote is created based on a product offer that is defined in a catalog. The quote 
identifies the product or set of products that are available to a customer, and includes characteristics such as pricing 
(eventually special pricing for the customer described in the quote), product options and agreement.  
Quote API performs the following operations on customer quote: 
- 
Retrieval of a customer quote or a collection of customer quote depending on filter criteria 
- 
Partial update of a customer quote (including updating rules) 
- 
Creation of a customer quote (including versioning, default values and creation rules) 
- 
Deletion of customer quote (for administration purposes) 
- 
Notification of events on quote 
o Quote creation 
o Quote removal 
o Quote state change 
o Quote value change used to notify that any data in an quote has just changed 
o Quote information required used to notify that some data in the quote need to be filled / are missing 
o Quote is a pending state waiting approval (for the whole quote or only for quote item) 
o quote is accepted by the customer but there is a least one agreement to be signed 
 
The following Assumptions were considered in the development of this document: 
- 
The customer quote management system has access to the commercial catalog system.  
- 
Supplier Quote is not managed in the scope of this document

Sample Use Cases 
Reader will find example of use cases using Usage API in “Open Digital Business Scenarios and Use Cases” document. 
The following table maps out the UC case with Internal/External actors. An internal actor is a representative of the 
ISP – an external is typically a representative of the prospect/customer. 
 
UC 
Actor 
Rule 
A new quote or a new version of a 
quote is created 
Internal 
External (Customer) 
 
An existing quote should be 
updated 
Internal 
External (Customer) 
Quote in status In Progress or Pending 
An existing quote should be 
validated before to be send to the 
customer  
Internal 
Quote in status In Progress or Pending 
An existing quote should be 
updated after submission to the 
customer 
Internal 
External 
Only status could be updated 
a quote or a collection of quotes 
should be retrieved 
Internal 
External (customer) 
For an external access special checks and 
conditions are required (quote status, 
fields retrieved) 
For technical reason a quote should 
be removed 
Internal 
 
 
In order to illustrate JSON message we will use a Quote with following features: 
• 
A global authorization  
• 
3 quote items: 
• 
For 10 lines for a TMF Tarif plan –  an 10% off catalog price will be awared 
• 
For 10 handsets (a commercial brochure will be provided in quote respone) 
• 
For a support free for the 12 first months.

Support of polymorphism and extension patterns 
 
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic 
meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, 
for instance a PricingRequest and Quoting inheriting properties from the Quote entity. 
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 
document. 
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of Quote 
instances some may be instances of PricingRequest where other could be instances of Quoting. The @type gives this 
information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is 
useful. 
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a QuoteRef object) to explicitly denote 
the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class 
type of the reference itself, such as PricingRequestRef or QuotingRef, and not the class type of the referred object. 
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. 
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or 
to specify the expected characteristics of an entity. 
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been 
extended.

Patch quote 
  PATCH /quote/{id} 
Description 
This operation allows partial updates of a quote entity. Support of json/merge (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) 
is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optional. 
 
Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning 
mandatory sub-resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH 
operation.  Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Lifecycle management extension to quote 
 
 
 
In Lifecycle Management, there is a requirement to distinguish between entities existing with different life cycle 
version numbers. The same quote may exist but with different version numbers.  
It may be possible for a sale administrator to see all the existing versions or for a partner to see only a subset of all 
the existing versions.  
The entity version number is not dependent on the version number of the API.  
In order to distinguish resources representing entities running with different version numbers and accessible 
though the same API version, the following directive can be used /id:(version=x) and the version attribute is added 
to each entity. 
 
{ 
    "id": "12dd-78hg", 
    "href": "https://host:port/quoteManagement/v4/quote/12dd-78hg", 
    "category": "BSBS Quote", 
    "description": "Quote illustration", 
    "effectiveQuoteCompletionDate": "2019-05-013T12:45:12.028Z", 
    "expectedFulfillmentStartDate": "2019-05-21T12:45:12.028Z", 
    "expectedQuoteCompletionDate": "2019-05-14T12:45:12.028Z", 
    "externalId": "QO-tr-89", 
    "instantSyncQuote": false, 
    "quoteDate": "2019-05-06T12:45:12.028Z", 
    "requestedQuoteCompletionDate": "2019-05-14T12:45:12.028Z", 
    "version": "1", 
    "agreement": [ 
        { 
            "id": "7778-jj56", 
            "href": "https://host:port/agreementManagement/v4/agreement/7778-jj56", 
            "name": "Global Agrrement", 
            "@baseType": "Agreement", 
            "@referredType": "MassAgreement" 
        } 
    ], 
    …. 
 
Note that the quote resources in this case may have the same ID but may be distinguished by the inclusion of the 
version number in their ID i.e. /Quote: 12dd-78hg (version=1.0), /Quote: 12dd-78hg (version=2.0). 
In the following examples, we will assume that two versions of the Quote exist. The Inactive and Active version 
have respectively version 1.0 and version 2.0.

Query all versioned quote resources 
 
Users with different roles may have access to different versions of the entities in the quote repository.  For 
example, user A may have access to only the version 1.0 of the entities while user B may have access to version 1.0 
and version 2.0. 
Sales Admin user has access to all the versions of the resources while other users have by default access to only the 
latest version of the quote.   
For example, the following request on the admin endpoint will return all the versioned resources matching a 
specific ID.

Query a specific versioned quote resource 
 
In general, a non-sales admin API user only has visibility to the latest version number or visibility to a subset of 
versioned catalog resources.   
It may be possible for an admin API user to retrieve a resource with a specific version number by using an ID and 
versioning filtering criteria.

Modify an existing version of a catalog resource 
 
By default, PATCH or PUT will be acting only on the latest version of a quote. For example, PATCH /…/quote/12dd-
78hg will only update the quote 12dd-78hg at Version 2.0 (which is the most current). 
To update a specific version of an entity the (Version=X) directive is added to the ID (i.e. /id:(version=x).  
Note that this capability is only available to API users having the proper authorizations to change the catalog 
entities with specific version numbers. 
 
For example, to change the quote 12dd-78hg versioned at 1.0 we could use: /quote/12dd-78hg (Version=1.0) 
REQUEST 
PATCH serverRoot/tmf-api/quoteManagement/v4/quote/12dd-78hg (Version=1.0)
