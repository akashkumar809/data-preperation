 General Information 
This document contains the text of the Business Process Framework for context and more information please refer to “GB991 Core Frameworks Concepts
and Principles” guidebook. 
 Preface 
eTOM Business Process Framework 
The eTOM or Business Process Framework is a reference framework for categorizing all the business activities used by an enterprise involved in delivering
on-line Information, Communications and Entertainment services. This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process 
components or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to
show organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. 
The eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and
the starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional 
application for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an 
industry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with 
other enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required 
functions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. 
 
 Introduction 
This document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out 
this domain. 
The focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke
Product, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes. 


The decomposition starts with a top level process which is a Core Process that details the activity that takes place and describes all subsequent activities 
that occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then
describing a unique path of action and further detail the specific process. This is then repeated to lower level of granularly of up to seven levees.  
At the start of each Level 2 process a diagram details all of its sub processes is placed. This diagram showers Level 3 process and the level 4 process 
below them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition
include another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   
Process Associations and IDs 
To aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. 
Processes have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: 
.b.x.c.d.e where  
 
b: 
This digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses 
to  
extended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   
x: 
Digit representing Domain  
c: 
Digit representing Level 2 process 
d: 
Digit representing Level 4 process 
e: 
Digit representing Level 5 process 
The unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. 


Typographic Conventions 
 
·  A Business Process is represented by a decorator in form of an arrow located to the top right. A red dot decorator with the initial TMF indicates that 
this is a TM Forum Business Process. The color yellow background hints to the business  layer.

Extended Description: 
Business Partner Strategy & Planning processes develop the strategies and policies of the enterprise for engaging with other parties. To support the 
enterprise’s supply and sourcing strategy the Business Partner Strategy and Planning processes develops the policies for Business Partner engagement, 
interaction and security. For example, the enterprise decides that it will outsource the supply of all Mobiles Networks; both the functional processes, as wel
as Infrastructure and Product Lifecycle Management processes. The effectuation of this is done according to policies and strategies set by the Business 
Partner Strategy and Planning processes.

Hierarchy L


 
 Develop Business Partner Security Strategy 
Process Identifier: 1.6.1.1 
Hierarchy Level: 3 
Brief Description: 
Business Partner security strategy processes are required to develop strategies that are consumable by automated governance systems.  
Business Partner security strategies are informed both by commercial and regulatory pressures. 
Extended Description: 
Business Partner security strategies are informed both by commercial and regulatory pressures and to handle threats.  
Note: 
Formal processes are required to develop strategy that is consumable by automated governance systems.   
Enterprises need to be able to create a suitable identity for all parties they interact with.    
The commercial aspects are derived from the value of trust, expectations and individual interests  that partners and consumers place with the enterprise.  
An additional challenge would be when international relationship concerns exist, and may be either ethically or legislative in nature. 
Failures to meet trust and expectations results in disengagement, and depresses business activity.  Regulatory pressures may include explicit 
consequences or corrective processes that can impact profitability.  The strategy also has to be framed in such a way as to enable any process to consum
the strategy.  In addition any strategy should define what feedback it requires to continuously validate its implementation. 


 Identify Consumer Security or Privacy Interests 
Process Identifier: 1.6.1.1.1 
Hierarchy Level: 4 
Brief Description: 
Identify Consumer Security or Privacy Interests, in particular the areas of activity exposed to consumer rights and privacy regulation. 
Extended Description: 
Identify Consumer Security or Privacy Interests informs any strategy or intents adopted or executed by the enterprise, in particular the areas of activity 
exposed to consumer rights and privacy regulation. 
Note: 
An enterprise needs to continuously validate and correct its understanding of the interests of participating consumers of the enterprise's services and 
products.  Most markets are subject to shifting concerns and regulations, and changes in how consumers view their exposures to those concerns. 
 Identify Upstream and Downstream Partner Security or Privacy Interests 
Process Identifier: 1.6.1.1.2 
Hierarchy Level: 4 
Brief Description: 
Identify Partner Security or Privacy Interests. This strategy may differ from parties covered by explicit consumer rights or privacy regulation. 
Extended Description: 
Identify Upstream and Downstream Partner Security or Privacy Interests informs any strategy or intents adopted or executed by the enterprise.  This 
strategy may differ from parties covered by explicit consumer rights or privacy regulation. 


Note: 
An enterprise needs to continuously validate and correct its understanding of any participating partners' interests.  Most ecosystems are subject to shifting 
concerns, and changes in how partners view their exposures to those concerns. 
 Identify Security or Privacy Interests of Partner's Consumers 
Process Identifier: 1.6.1.1.3 
Hierarchy Level: 4 
Brief Description: 
Identify Partner's Consumers Security or Privacy Interests. This strategy may differ from parties covered by explicit consumer rights or privacy regulation. 
Extended Description: 
Identify Security or Privacy Interests of Partner's Consumers informs any strategy or intents adopted or executed by the enterprise. 
Note: 
An enterprise needs to continuously validate and correct its understanding of any participating partner's consumer's interests.  Most markets are subject to
shifting concerns, and changes in how partner's consumers view their exposures to those concerns.   
 
This process looks at the rights and privacy needs of the organization's partners consumers, that would still require a legal or ethical obligation. 
 Identify National and International Security Interests 
Process Identifier: 1.6.1.1.4 
Hierarchy Level: 4 


Brief Description: 
Continuously validate and correct the Enterprise's understanding of any sovereign interests.

Extended Description: 
Identify National and International Security Interests informs any strategy or intents adopted or executed by the enterprise. 
Note: 
An enterprise needs to continuously validate and correct its understanding of any sovereign interests.  Most markets are subject to shifting concerns, and 
changes in how national entities view their exposures to those concerns.   
 
In particular national concerns may impose particular needs to be met with regards security.  An additional challenge would be when international 
relationship concerns exist, and may be either ethically or legislative in nature.  A partner's engagement with corrupt or belligerent third parties would result
in a suitable policy response. 
 Define Security and Privacy Domains 
Process Identifier: 1.6.1.1.5 
Hierarchy Level: 4 
Brief Description: 
Define Security and Privacy Domains boundaries that limit any policies and intents.  While some domain boundaries may be set at the discretion of the 
enterprise, many other are imposed by regulation or law. 
Extended Description: 


Define Security and Privacy Domains boundaries that limit any policies and intents. 
Note: 
Enterprises need to define and manage any boundaries that limit any policies and intents.  While some domain boundaries may be set at the discretion of 
the enterprise, many other are imposed by regulation or law.  In either case, the domains defined will need constant review and analysis to ensure that 
business plans and risks are kept within acceptable levels of uncertainty while evolving.

Hierarchy Level: 2 


Brief Description: 
Business Partner Tender Management processes manage the activities associated with developing tender documents, running tender processes, gaining 
enterprise agreement to tender decisions. 
Extended Description: 
Business Partner Tender Management processes manage the activities associated with developing tender documents, running tender processes, gaining 
enterprise agreement to tender decisions. 
The tender process for the sourcing activity can be used not only for managing the sourcing of infrastructure of various types, but is also applicable for use
in outsourcing tender processes, and for the sourcing of commodity items used within a business. The actual depth to which the sourcing process is used i
dependent on such factors as the value of the sourced items. Note that these processes can also be used for the negotiated agreements between the 
enterprise and its competitors as a part of regulated inter-carrier agreements. While tender processes are not used in such a case, the processes for 
determining appropriate commercial arrangements and for gaining enterprise agreement are used for these regulated and competitive activities. 
They also manage the evaluation of agreements with parties, to determine those with the products and services that best meet the enterprise’s needs.

Extended Description: 
Manage the establishment of agreements with business partners; Initiate and complete business agreements when one or more business partners are 
involved. Such agreements may lead to the establishment of a contract as a legally binding document between the parties involved. Contract Management
is defined as part of the Enterprise Governance process. 
Extended Description: 
Business Partner Agreement Management manages all aspects of agreements with business partners. Agreements include: 
•Purchasing agreements for products, services, and resources that meet the enterprise’s needs. 
•On-boarding agreements for business partners’ offerings 
•Service Level Agreements with one or more other business partners 
•Agreements to use a business partner as a sales channel 
•Agreements based on a reusable template which is used to create any of the above. 
Note: Applicable sub-processes are also used by other processes, such as Product Offering Agreement Management and Business Partner Privacy 
Management to manage these types of agreements to avoid duplication of the sub-processes. 
Initiate and complete business agreements with Business Partners, to allow the delivery of business and technical capabilities required by the enterprise. 
For example, through these processes, the enterprise might contract with a supplier of a new-generation mobile network and put in place links between the
IT Systems of the Business Partner and the enterprise, ready to allow specific processes and product offerings to be developed. 
This process is also responsible for the establishment of commercial agreements between the enterprise and external business partners/providers on B2B
frameworks and interactions. 
Agreements may be formalized as legal contracts under the responsibility of the Contract Management process as defined in the Enterprise Governance 
process. 


Business Partner Agreement Management also manages the agreement for established arrangements and processes between the enterprise and the 
selected Business Partner as well as specifications for deliverables within the context of the negotiated agreement. 
This process particularly applies when the commercial arrangements between business partners exist over an extended period, and the commercial 
agreement allows for the on-going specification of deliverables within the period of the commercial agreement. Shorter-term commercial agreements are 
unlikely to require the comprehensive level of commercial administration that these processes bring (but note that Business Partner Support & Readiness 
processes may have a role in this case). 
The name of this process was changed in 24.0 old name was Party Agreement Management

Party Special Event Management plans, prepares, and produces a special event which targets one or more types of parties. It includes the assessment, 
definition, acquisition, allocation, direction, control, and analysis of time, finances, people, products, services, and other resources to achieve an event's 
objectives.  
 
It is integrated with project management disciplines, such as forming teams, scheduling all event management tasks, monitoring tasks, and so forth. 
Particularly important is the designation of an event manager who oversees and arranges every aspect of an event, including researching, planning, 
organizing, implementing, controlling, and evaluating an event’s design, activities, and production. 
 
It interacts with other processes, such as Party Agreement Management, Marketing Campaign Management, and Marketing Communications. 
 


An event may be for internal or external parties, accompany a new product line, offering, campaign, and so forth. It may be scheduled by another Party 
where infrastructure is needed to support their event. In this case not all processes would be executed by an enterprise. An enterprise may focus on just th
operations aspects of the event, such as operations initiation, planning, implementation, execution, closure, and evaluation.

Process Identifier: 1.6.15 
Hierarchy Level: 2 
Brief Description: 
Business Partner Bill/Invoice Management manages the Business Partner  bill/invoice process, controls bills/invoices, manages the lifecycle of

Extended Description: 
Business Partner Bill/Invoice Management manages the Business Partner  bill/invoice process, controls bills/invoices, manages the lifecycle of 
bills/invoices. 
 
A bill is a notice for payment which is supposed to be preceded by an invoice in most cases. An invoice typically does not summarize to total outstanding 
payment or payments due.  A bill typically contains the payment due date and outstanding payment or advanced payment. 
 


Party Bill/Invoice Process Management makes certain that there is capability so that the Bill Invoice Management processes can operate effectively. It also
designs and develops an enterprises invoicing process.  
 
Party Bill/Invoice  Control establishes and maintains party bill invoice formats, and any interaction with specific parties to modify the format. It maintains list
of parties who are eligible for receiving bills/invoices. 
 
Party Bill/Invoice Lifecycle Management  generates bills/invoices for products that were provided by an enterprise on behalf of another party. It also 
receives bills/invoices for products that were provided by another party on an enterprise's behalf.  
 
Major Differentiation Factors for a separate Invoice Generation:  
• Invoice Timeliness - Generation happen monthly but often also biweekly. In contrast to Retail where it is critical customer's invoice is being generating on 
time,  (Cost of Infrastructure, ability to re-invoice, apply adjustments) and dependency on reconciliation (often manually externally driven), requires 
• Invoice Accuracy – The tolerance for accepting differences between the balance of two invoices is much higher than for retail. By implication checks and 
balances 
 
The Invoice document does not summarize to total outstanding payment or payments due. The Bill contains the payment due date and Balance.  
Interconnect charges may be incurred for all call attempts rather than just those that succeed and are charged to the retail customer. 
 
Further Sub processes impacted  


Tax Jurisdiction Applied -The process of applying Taxes according to applicable Jurisdictions for National and Multinational Customers applicable for 
various services. In certain countries it is standard practice to outsource sub functions of Tax Determinations to specialized external entities.  
Interconnect charges may be incurred for all call attempts rather than just those that succeed and are charged to the retail customer. 
Reflect the whole route of the call, not just the origination and termination points. 
As a consequence, for example the Interconnect Invoice will be generated from  
• Data & Voice CDRs that is only billable for Interconnect providers. E.g.: Outgoing calls (revenue shared), Outgoing Transit calls, Incoming calls, etc. The 
model simplifies it in terms of a balance in MOU (minutes of use).  The Outgoing calls are the expense and Incoming calls are the revenue for the Telecom
Provider.

Extended Description: 
Administer Commercial Arrangement for BP Bill/Invoice Creation Capability establishes the requirements for, and manages the agreed commercial 
arrangements with, appropriate outsourced parties who will create bill/invoices for the enterprise.    An outsourced approach such as this requires the 
exchange of usage and latest BP details, including whatever is required for rating/pricing calculations, details of the parties' products and their postal 


address, and will result in bills/invoices generated 'as if' the enterprise had produced them internally. The business logos and contact details on the invoice
produced by the 'billing on behalf of' (BOBO) vendor will be those of the enterprise outsourcing their billing. The BOBO vendor will usually not have any of 
their details present on the bills/invoices since  the BOBO vendor is providing a transparent 'back office' billing function about which the end parties are 
unaware.   Note that when establishing arrangements with an outsourced BP or parties this process interacts with BP Tender Management and BP

Develop, maintain, and remove Business Partner revenue sharing models that define how revenue is shared by and enterprise with one or more other 
parties. Revenue sharing models are a key component revenue sharing agreements. 
Extended Description: 
Business Partner Revenue Sharing Model Development develops, maintains, and removes Business Partner revenue sharing models that define how 
revenue is shared by and enterprise with one or more other parties. Revenue sharing models are a key component revenue sharing agreements. 
This process reuses the Product Offering Pricing processes to manage the lifecycle of the amounts of revenue shared. For example, an enterprise may 
charge 10 euros for an offering and share a flat 4 euros with another Business Partner, such as an application developer. For configurable offerings the 
revenue shared may be dependent on those features chosen by the Business Partner who acquires the offering. In this case the revenue shared is also 
governed by the configuration of the Business Partner's product. A similar case applies to usage based revenue sharing.  Flat rate and usage based 
revenue sharing models are just two of a number of models, which also include but are not limited to tiered, commitment, progressive, along with multi-
Business Partner variations of each.  
 
Business Partner specific revenue sharing models may be prepared in advance and negotiated  as part of entering into an agreement with a Business 
Partner to be on-boarded and on-boarding their offerings.

revenue sharing model.  For example, for a flat rate revenue sharing model an enterprise may be willing to share 70% of the product offering price with 
another Business Partner. The range can be based on the processes that an enterprise and a Business Partner provide. For example, if an enterprise only
accepts an order for an offering while a Business Partner performs all other processes, such as fulfilling the order, accepting payment for it, and billing for i
it may be willing to share up to 90 percent of the revenue it receives for the offering.

of a Business Partner revenue sharing model. 
 
Ranges may be expressed in percentages or some other quantitative measure that an enterprise will use to negotiate the aspects of a Business Partner 
revenue sharing model.  For example, for a flat rate revenue sharing model an enterprise may be willing to share 70% of the product offering price with 
another Business Partner. The range can be based on the processes that an enterprise and a Business Partner provide. For example, if an enterprise only


accepts an order for an offering while a Business Partner performs all other processes, such as fulfilling the order, accepting payment for it, and billing for i
it may be willing to share up to 90 percent of the revenue it receives for the offering. 
 
More complex ranges, such as for tiered and progressive revenue sharing models may be based on policy defined by an enterprise. For example, a tiered 
model may have a range of 60-70% revenue share for up to 100 product offerings acquired and a range of 80-90% for above 100 offerings. Ranges may 
also include a range of prices for an offering paired with revenue sharing ranges. To date there are no common processes that can be used to define 
policies defined by an enterprise. 
 Define Business Partner Revenue Sharing Model

Extended Description: 
Define Business Partner Revenue Sharing Model defines basic information about the model, such as its validity period and version, parties and their 
involved offerings as well as how revenue is shared among an enterprise and the parties involved. This process reuses the Product Offering Pricing 
processes to manage the lifecycle of the amounts of revenue shared . For example, an enterprise may charge 10 euros for an offering and share a flat 4 
euros with another Business Partner, such as an application developer.  
 
The type of Business Partner revenue sharing model is defined by its related Business Partner revenue sharing model specification, such as flat rate and 
usage based revenue sharing. 


 
This process may add one or more other parties to an existing model. For example, an offering, such as a health monitoring service that includes a device,
provided by a single Business Partner may be split into offerings provided by two parties, one providing the monitoring service and another providing the 
device.

Partner's offering. 
 
The amount shared may depend on which processes an entries or a Business Partner carries out with respect to an offering, such as fulfilled by, billed by, 
and so forth. For example, if an enterprise fulfills an order on behalf of a Business Partner and accepts payment on behalf of a Business Partner then the 
revenue shared with a Business Partner will be less than if a Business Partner fulfills the order and accepts payment after it has been placed with an 
enterprise. 
 
Note that the revenue is defined by reusing the Product Offering Pricing process.

example, an enterprise may charge a listing fee for a Business Partner's offering or offerings as part of an agreement between a Business Partner and an 
enterprise, and an enterprise passes all revenue on to the Business Partner for sales of the Business Partner's offering. The Business Partner is invoiced 
separately for the listing fee.
