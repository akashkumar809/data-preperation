Management 
TMFC006 Service Catalog Management component is 
responsible for organizing the collection of 
service specifications that identify and define 
all requirements of a service that can be 
performed. 
Service Catalog Management component 
has the functionality that enable present a 
customer-facing view so users are able to 
search and select services they need, as 
well as a technical view to enable define and 
setup what's needed to deliver service 
specifications (Customer Facing Service 
Specifications (CFSSs) and Resource 
Facing Service Specifications (RFSSs)) 
contained in the service catalog. 
Service Catalog Management component 
has functionalities that include creation of 
new service specifications, managing service 
specifications, administering the lifecycle of 
services, describing relationships between 
service specification attributes, reporting on 
service specification and their changes, and 
facilitating easy and systematic indexing and 
access to services, as well as facilitate 
automating the service delivery process.

Service Specifications Management can result in 
establishing, in a centralized way, technical (know-how) 
standards. 
Such standards provide the organization with a means to 
control and approve the values and inputs of service

It consists in evaluating if a requester 
is granted the permission to act by 
providing the required evidence. The 
evidence corresponds to the 
condition specified for each right (for 
instance keying the correct password 
to use a specific mailbox). If the 
action is protected via a right which is 
assigned (possibly via a role) to a 
person then the person has to be 
identified to retrieve their rights and 
verify if the request to act can be 
granted.

Auditing manages the implications of 
Service Specifications changes to

changes may impact other CFSSpec 
according to relationships and also 
Product Specification that restrict it. 
Resources Facing Service

other RFSSpecs according to 
relationships and / or CFSSpecs it 
realizes. 
The function logs Service

The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 4: 
 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component.  
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs.  
• 
List of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may 
consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each 
defined event.

3.3.  Events 
The diagram illustrates the Events which the component may publish and the Events 
that the component may subscribe to and then may receive. Both lists are derived from 
the APIs listed in the preceding sections. 
 
 
The type of event could be: 
• 
Create : a new resource has been created (following a POST). 
• 
Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. 
• 
AttributeValueChange or Change: an attribute from the resource has changed - 
event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing 
to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
StateChange: resource state has changed.
