INTRODUCTION 
 
The following document is the specification of the REST API for geographic location management. It 
includes the model definition as well as all available operations. 
A Geographic Location is a point, a surface or a volume defined by geographic point(s). These points 
should be associated with accuracy and a spatial reference. 
The geographic location API provides a standardized client interface to a location management system. 
. 
 


SAMPLE USE CASES 
Reader will find example of use cases using Usage API in “Open Digital Business Scenarios and Use 
Cases” document. 
 
 
 


RESOURCE MODEL

Notification Resource Models 
 
4 notifications are defined for this API 
Notifications related to RetrieveGeographicLocation: 
    - RetrieveGeographicLocationCreationNotification 
    - RetrieveGeographicLocationChangeNotification 
Notifications related to RetrieveLocationRelation: 
    - RetrieveLocationRelationCreationNotification 
    - RetrieveLocationRelationChangeNotification 
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the figure below. 
A notification resource (depicted by "SpecificNotification" placeholder) is a sub class of a generic 
Notification structure containing an id of the event occurrence (eventId), an event timestamp (eventTime), 
and the name of the notification resource (eventType).  
This notification structure owns an event structure ("SpecificEvent" placeholder) linked to the resource 
concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field ("resourceName" placeholder). 


 
RETRIEVE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION CREATION NOTIFICATION 
Notification sent when a new RetrieveGeographicLocation resource is created.

OPERATIONS ON GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION 
LIST GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS 
  GET /geographicLocation?fields=...&{filtering} 
Description 
This operation list geographic location entities. 
Attribute selection is enabled for all first level attributes. 
Filtering may be available depending on the compliance level supported by an implementation. 
Providing filtering criteria is mandatory to avoid too many answers retrieved. To provide example it 
could filtering on name or on geographic point(s) plan/volume.

API NOTIFICATIONS 
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST 
notification POST calls. 
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST 
Guidelines reproduced below. 
REGISTER LISTENER 
  POST /hub 
Description 
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its 
health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if 
it does not support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint 
can be created again. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for registering a listener. 
 
 
Request 
 
POST /api/hub 
Accept: application/json 
 
{"callback": "http://in.listener.com"} 
 
 
Response 
 
201 
Content-Type: application/json 
Location: /api/hub/42 
 
{"id":"42","callback":"http://in.listener.com","query":null} 
 
 
 


UNREGISTER LISTENER 
  DELETE /hub/{id} 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. 
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. 
 
Request 
 
DELETE /api/hub/42 
Accept: application/json 
 
 
Response 
 
204 
 
PUBLISH EVENT TO LISTENER 
  POST /client/listener 
Description 
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. 
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the 
callback url passed when registering the listener. 
Behavior 
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  
Usage Samples 
Here's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE” should be 
replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification Resources Models 
section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given notification type. 


 
Request 
 
POST /client/listener 
Accept: application/json 
 
{ 
    "event": {  
                EVENT BODY  
            }, 
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE" 
} 
 
 
Response 
 
201

Guidelines.
