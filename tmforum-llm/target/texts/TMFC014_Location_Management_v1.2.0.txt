Function 
Block 
Location 
Management 
TMFC014 The Location Management Component allows 
easy reference to geographic places important 
to other entities, where a geographic place is 
an entity that can answer the question 
“where?” . This component could be a facade 
tool into GIS systems (e.g. Google Maps)  
Also covers the operations to manage (create, 
read, delete)  geographic sites that can be 
associated with a customer, account, service 
delivery or other entities. 
And finally gives the capabilities to retrieve 
/list /validate addresses that are named as 
structured textual ways of describing how to 
find a Property in an urban area (country 
properties are often defined differently). It 
allows looking data for worldwide addresses 
through popular GIS systems like Google 
Maps or government master addresses 
systems. 
It can also be used to validate geographic 
data, to be sure that it corresponds to a real 
geographic address. 
Finally, it can be used to look for an address 
by: searching an area as a start (city, town ), 
then zooming on the streets of this area, and 
finally listing all the street segments (numbers) 
in a street.

3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events 
The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. At 
this stage we list the APIs, resource and operation we no mention 
to optionality (in other word no mention about mandatory VS optional resource) 
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs. At this stage no optionality 
is defined and none of this 'required' API is listed as 'mandatory' 
• 
List of Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may 
consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each 
defined event.
