version. As soon as the interface will be published it will be added to the table.

3.3. Events 
The diagram illustrates the Events which the component publishes and the Events that 
the component subscribes to and then receives. Both lists are derived from the APIs 
listed in the preceding sections. 
The type of event could be: 
• 
Create: a new resource has been created (following a POST). 
• 
Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. 
• 
AttributeValueChange: an attribute from the resource has changed - event 
structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing 
to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
StateChange: resource state has changed.

information, customer contracts and service orders. And review L3 1.3.3.7 - 
Close Customer Order definition and clarify close/complete terminology and link 
with 1.3.3.4 - Complete Customer Order (do we need 2 L3 ?). 
• 
1.3.3.8 - Manage Order Fallout: as this L3 is shared by POCV and POOM 
components (to be consistent with Functional Framework mapping), clarify 
which type of fallout need to be managed during the order delivery 
orchestration (at POOM level) and which need to be managed at Product Order 
Capture and Follow-Up level (by POCV).

provide an interface for the customer to capture a set of information ?)

How can we trigger the Product Configurator for configuration ? Refer to JIRA

How can we evaluate Customer Credit (refer to Function 205 for definition) : 
can this check be added in TMF696 - Risk Management API ?
