 Introduction
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for revenue sharing algorithms
management. It includes the model definition as well as all available operations.


 Sample Use Cases
Reader will find example of use cases using Partner Revenue Sharing Algorithms API in
“Zero-Touch Partnering Use-Cases” document.


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, for instance a BillingAccount and
SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of Account instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where
other could be instances of SettlementAccount. The @type gives this information. All
resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when
this is useful.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef
object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference
entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as
BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in
reference objects.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.

Notification Resource Models
4 notifications are defined for this API.
Notifications related to PartyRevSharingAlgorithm:
• Party Rev Sharing Algorithm Attribute Value Change Event
• Party Rev Sharing Algorithm State Change Event
• Party Rev Sharing Algorithm Create Event
• Party Rev Sharing Algorithm Delete Event
The notification structure for all notifications in this API follow the pattern depicted by the
figure below. A notification event resource (depicted by "SpecificEvent" placeholder) is a sub
class of a generic Event structure containing at least an id of the event occurrence (eventId),
an event timestamp (eventTime), and the name of the resource (eventType). This notification
structure owns an event payload structure ("SpecificEventPayload" placeholder) linked to the
resource concerned by the notification using the resource name as access field
("resourceName" placeholder).

Updates partially a PartyRevSharingAlgorithm
PATCH /partyRevSharingAlgorithm/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a PartyRevSharingAlgorithm entity. Support of
json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) 
is 
mandatory, 
support 
of 
json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Deletes a PartyRevSharingAlgorithm
DELETE /partyRevSharingAlgorithm/{id}
Description
This operation deletes a PartyRevSharingAlgorithm entity.


 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
201
For detailed examples on the general TM Forum notification mechanism, see the TMF REST
Design Guidelines.
