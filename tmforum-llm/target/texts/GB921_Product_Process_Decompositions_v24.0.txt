 General Information 
This document contains the text of the Business Process Framework for context and more information please refer to âGB991 Core Frameworks Concepts
and Principlesâ guidebook. 
 Preface 
eTOM Business Process Framework 
The eTOM or Business Process Framework is a reference framework for categorizing all the business activities used by an enterprise involved in delivering
on-line Information, Communications and Entertainment services. This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process 
components or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to
show organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. 
The eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and
the starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional 
application for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an 
industry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with 
other enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required 
functions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. 
 Introduction 
This document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out 
this domain. 
The focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke
Product, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes. 


The decomposition starts with a top level process which is a Core Process that details the activity that takes place and describes all subsequent activities 
that occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then
describing a unique path of action and further detail the specific process. This is then repeated to lower level of granularly of up to seven levees.  
At the start of each Level 2 process a diagram details all of its sub processes is placed. This diagram showers Level 3 process and the level 4 process 
below them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition
include another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   
Process Associations and IDs 
To aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. 
Processes have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: 
.b.x.c.d.e where  
 
b: 
This digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses 
to  
extended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   
x: 
Digit representing Domain  
c: 
Digit representing Level 2 process 
d: 
Digit representing Level 4 process 
e: 
Digit representing Level 5 process 
The unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. 


Typographic Conventions 
 
Â·  A Business Process is represented by a decorator in form of an arrow located to the top right. A red dot decorator with the initial TMF indicates that 
this is a TM Forum Business Process. The color yellow background hints to the business  layer.

Product offerings represent the types of services and resources made available to the market by an enterprise.  
 


The key measures of this process are how effectively the enterpriseâs offerings are broadened by these offerings or new offering features. These processe
also manage updates and enhancements to product offerings. Business case development tracking and commitment are key elements of this process. 
 
Note that some of these processes, such as Gather New Product Offering Ideas and Develop New Product Offering Business Proposal, may be performed
in conjunction with the equivalent process in Product Specification Development & Retirement. For example, if ideas for a new specification or feature are 
being developed ideas on how to offer it to the market may also be gathered; or if a new offering is being considered it may require new features defined fo
the specification or one or more new specifications to be developed for it.

The other types of prices define various forms of rules that determine what price should be used under certain conditions. For example, policy-based pricin
may determine if a customer qualifies for a discount based on what product offerings are ordered, algorithmic pricing defines matrices of properties/feature
used to determine a price, feature/property-based pricing determines a price based on the selection of one or more properties or features by a customer.

online) that advertise the promotion to reach the market, customers and channels. 
 
Product offering promotions can be designed with different ends in mind, including introducing a new product, retaining customers, bringing in new 
customers, and increasing sales of a product already on the market. 
 


Product Offering Promotion Development works with other processes, such as Market Research, Marketing Campaign Management, Marketing 
Communications, and Advertising Management to design the promotion and advertising. One of the key roles of all these processes is to position the 
product in the market, especially versus competitive products.

 Product Usage Management 
Process Identifier: 1.2.16 
Hierarchy Level: 2 
Brief Description: 


Extended Description: 
The Product Usage management processes encompass the functions required to guide, distribute, mediate, summarize, accumulate, and analyze Product
Usage records. These processes may occur in real-time, near real-time (i.e. just at the end of the usage), or may be executed on a periodic basis. 
 
 
Based on Service Usage, this process aims at identifying Product Usage. For example, for a Video on Demand where you can watch a video as many time
as you want during 72 hours, several Service Usages might have been tracked (each time the user watches the video) and only one Product Usage will be
identified for all Service Usages in the 72 hours after the first watch. 
 
The guiding processes ensures that the Product Usage records used in the billing processes are appropriately related to the correct customer billing 
account and products.  
 
The Product Usage records are edited and if necessary reformatted (mediated) to meet the needs of subsequent processes. The billing event records may
also be enriched with additional data during this process.
