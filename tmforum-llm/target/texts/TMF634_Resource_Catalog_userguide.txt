 Introduction
The following document is the user guide of the REST API for Resource Catalog
Management. It includes the model definition as well as all available operations.
The Resource Catalog Management API allows the management of the entire lifecycle of the
Resource Catalog elements and the consultation of resource catalog elements during
several processes such as ordering process.


 Lifecycle Management Use Cases
The Resource Catalog Management API allows the management of the entire lifecycle of the
resource catalog elements. The followings are use case examples of Resource Catalog
Management. Please refer to Frameworx guidebook GB978 for more information.
UC1: A partner updates his catalog. He notifies his distributor the catalog change. The
distributor requests a catalog export. Then, he retrieves the catalog at the provided URL.

UC3: A catalog administrator wants to retrieve effective duration of a resource candidate
based 
on 
resource 
candidate 
identifier 
or 
other 
search 
criteria 
(GET
/resourceCandidate/{ID}).
UC4: A catalog administrator wants to retrieve all resource candidates in resource catalog
(GET /resourceCandidate).
UC5: A catalog administrator wants to update the lifecycle status (from Launched to retired
for example) of a resource candidate (PATCH /resourceCandidate/{ID}).


 Lifecycle Management
Resource Lifecycle Management is responsible for managing the entire lifecycle of the
resource catalog element and its underlying components. This include all the processes
required to design, build, deploy, maintain and ultimately retire the catalog element.

• When the macro conception of a catalog element is started the first status is “In study”.
• When the conception of the catalog element is accepted, its status is changed to “In
design”.
• If the design is approved its status is changed to “In test”.
• Then either the test is OK and then its status is changed to “Active” or the test is KO and
its status is changed to “Rejected”. The "Rejected" status is a final status.
• When a catalog element is in a “Active” status it means, it has been validated and
tested, but it is still not available for customers.
• When the beginning of marketing is reached, its status is changed to “Launched”. At this
moment, customers can buy it.
• If the catalog element is not launched, its status is changed to “Retired”.
• The same status is achieved when a catalog element reaches the end of marketing.
• The “Retired” status means it cannot be sold to any new customers, but previous
customers can still have it.
• When no more customer holds the catalog element, its status is changed to “Obsolete”
meaning it can be removed from the catalog.


 Support of polymorphism and extension
patterns
Support of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by
means of a list of generic meta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in
collections 
occurs 
when 
entities 
inherit 
from 
base 
entities, 
for 
instance 
a
PhysicalResourceSpecification and LogicalResourceSpecification inheriting properties from
the base ResourceSpecification entity.
Generic support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API
Guidelines, Part 2 (TMF630).
The @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For
example, within a list of ResourceSpecification instances some may be instances of
PhysicalResourceSpecification 
where 
other 
could 
be 
instances 
of
LogicalResourceSpecification. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-
resources of this API have a @type attributes that must be provided.
The @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an
ResourceSpecificationRef object) to explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred
class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class type of the
reference 
itself, 
such 
as 
PhysicalResourceSpecificationRef 
or
LogicalResourceSpecificationRef, and not the class type of the referred object.
The @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined
properties of an Entity or to specify the expected characteristics of an entity.
The @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given
resource that has been extended.


 Characteristics and Features
The catalog model allows a specification to be described by characteristics and/or by
features. Both approaches are valid, and they can be combined in the same specification.
Characteristics
A characteristic is a name-value pair defining an aspect of the instantiated entity. The
corresponding characteristic specification includes metadata such as:
• The name of the characteristic
• The value (data) type of the characteristic (could be simple or complex)
• Whether or not the value can be set at instantiation
• Whether or not the value must be supplied at instantiation, and the cardinality (how many
values are allowed)
• List or range of allowed values
For example, a virtual firewall can run on multiple operating systems. This could be
implemented as a characteristic describing the operating system hosting the firewall.
• The name of the characteristic could be Host Operating System
• The value type would be string
• It is a configurable characteristic
• The value must be supplied
• The valid values could be RH Linux, Ubuntu, Oracle Linux
In the characteristic approach, the onus is on the consumer of the inventory API to set
characteristic values explicitly according to the metadata provided by the corresponding
catalog API.
Features
A feature is an intent-based way of specifying the capabilities of the instantiated entity. The
feature is defined by a feature specification that typically includes characteristics and related
definitions, but at instantiation time the feature is simply selected (by default or explicitly by
the consumer of the inventory API) and the behavior is applied implicitly.
For example, a virtual firewall may be able to operate based on layer 4 (stateful firewall) or
layer 7 (application) of the OSI networking model. A feature would be defined for each of
these capabilities. At instantiation time, the consumer would select (say) the layer 7 feature
and thus the instantiated firewall would operate at layer 7.
Characteristic-Based or Schema-Based
The Open API Catalog models, Resource Catalog included, present two complementary
methods for defining how entities can be instantiated:


 • Characteristic-based
• Schema-based
These approaches will be compared using an example of a Virtual Storage resource, which
has a characteristic Maximum Storage.
Characteristic-Based
In this approach, the characteristics of the entity are specified dynamically, using the
CharacteristicSpecification to define the behavior of the characteristic. A JSON fragment
might appear as follows:
{
  "name": "Virtual Storage Medium",
  "description": "This resource specification defines the virtual storage medium",
  "@type": "ResourceSpecification",
  "resourceSpecCharacteristic": [
    {
      "name": "Maximum Allowed Storage",
      "description":
        "The storage limit in the virtual storage medium, ",
      "valueType": "integer",
      "configurable": true,
      "minCardinality": 1,
      "maxCardinality": 1,
      "isUnique": true,
      "@type": "CharacteristicSpecification",
      "characteristicValueSpecification": [
        {
          "value": 1024000,
          "@type": "IntegerCharacteristicValueSpecification"
        },
        {
          "value": 2048000,
          "@type": "IntegerCharacteristicValueSpecification"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
This fragment shows that the characteristic is named Maximum Allowed Storage, and has
valid values 1G and 2G, one of which must be chosen when instantiating a particular
storage.
Schema-Based
In this approach, the characteristics of the entity are specified in a strongly-typed schema,
and the specification points to the schema. A JSON fragment might appear as follows:
{
  "name": "Virtual Storage Medium",
  "description":
    "This resource specification defines the virtual storage medium",
  "@type": "ResourceSpecification",


   "targetResourceSchema": {
    "@type": "VirtualStorage",
    "@schemaLocation": "https://mycsp.com:8080/tmf-
api/schema/Resource/VirtualStorage.schema.json"
  }
}
And the referred schema file might appear as follows:
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "VirtualStorage.schema.json",
  "title": "VirtualStorage",
  "definitions": {
    "VirtualStorage ": {
      "$id": "# VirtualStorage ",
      "description":
        "This resource specification defines the virtual storage medium.",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "Maximum Allowed Storage": {
          "type": "integer",
          "description": "The storage limit in the virtual storage medium",
          "enum": [1024000, 2048000]
        }
      },
      "required": ["Maximum Allowed Storage"],
      "allOf": [
        {
          "$ref":
"LogicalResourceSpecification.schema.json#/components/schemas/LogicalResourceSpecifi
cation"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
This fragment shows that Virtual Storage has a strongly-typed attribute named Maximum
Allowed Storage, with valid values 1G and 2G, one of which must be chosen when
instantiating a particular storage.
Note: in this paradigm the metadata describing the attribute is limited by the semantics of
json schema. Additional metadata, that is part of the Characteristic Specification model, is
not represented in the schema file.

A String. Description of this REST resource.
externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple

externalIdentifier
An ExternalIdentifier. An identification of an entity that is owned
by or originates in a software system different from the current
system, for example a ProductOrder handed off from a
commerce platform into an order handling system. The structure
identifies the system itself, the nature of the entity within the
system (e.g. class name) and the unique ID of the entity within
the system. It is anticipated that multiple external IDs can be held
for a single entity, e.g. if the entity passed through multiple
systems on the way to the current system. In this case the
consumer is expected to sequence the IDs in the array in reverse
order of provenance, i.e. most recent system first in the list.

range of values, (for example, sensitivity of 100-240 mV), or can
be derived from a formula (for example, usage time (hrs) = 30 -
talk time *3). Certain characteristics, such as color, may be
configured during the ordering or some other process.
resourceSpecRelationship
A ResourceSpecificationRelationship. A migration, substitution,
dependency or exclusivity relationship between/among resource
specifications.
sku
A String. This is a string that defines the manufacturer-allocated
Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) number of the hardware item. This is

(endDateTime only) a startDateTime only, or both.
vendor
A String. This is a string that defines the name of the
manufacturer. This, in combination with the Model and the Part,
identify different types of hardware items. The SerialNumber can
then be used to differentiate between different instances of the
same type of hardware item. This is a REQUIRED attribute for a
physical resource.
version
A String. Resource Specification version.
@baseType
A String. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class.
@schemaLocation

(endDateTime only) a startDateTime only, or both.
@baseType
A String. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class.
@schemaLocation
A String. A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional
attributes and relationships.
@type
A String. When sub-classing, this defines the sub-class
Extensible name.
AttachmentRef sub-resource fields
description
A String. A narrative text describing the content of the
attachment.

A String. Hyperlink reference.
id
A String. Unique identifier.
name
A String. Name of the referred entity.
url
A String. Link to the attachment media/content.
@baseType

Extensible name.
CharacteristicSpecification sub-resource fields
charSpecRelationship
A CharacteristicSpecificationRelationship. An aggregation,
migration, substitution, dependency or exclusivity relationship
between/among Specification Characteristics.
characteristicValueSpecification
A CharacteristicValueSpecification. A
CharacteristicValueSpecification object is used to define a set of
attributes, each of which can be assigned to a corresponding set
of attributes in a CharacteristicSpecification object. The values of
the attributes in the CharacteristicValueSpecification object
describe the values of the attributes that a corresponding
Characteristic object can take on.
configurable
A Boolean. If true, the Boolean indicates that the target
Characteristic is configurable.

This operation allows partial updates of a ResourceCatalog entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

This operation allows partial updates of a ResourceCandidate entity. Support of json/merge
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) is mandatory, support of json/patch (http://tools.ietf.org/
html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the creation of sub-resources
or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-resource attributes and default
value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH operation. Hence these tables
are not repeated here.

Updates partially a ResourceSpecification
PATCH /resourceSpecification/{id}?fields=…
Description
This operation allows partial updates of a ResourceSpecification entity. Support of
json/merge 
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7386) 
is 
mandatory, 
support 
of 
json/patch
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789) is optiona. Note: If the update operation yields to the
creation of sub-resources or relationships, the same rules concerning mandatory sub-
resource attributes and default value settings in the POST operation applies to the PATCH
operation. Hence these tables are not repeated here.

Deletes a ResourceSpecification
DELETE /resourceSpecification/{id}
Description
This operation deletes a ResourceSpecification entity.
Usage samples
Here's an example of a request for deleting a specification.
Request
DELETE /resourceSpecification/42
Content-Type: application/json
Response


 
204


 API NOTIFICATIONS
For every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample
REST notification POST calls.
It is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in
the REST Guidelines reproduced below.
Register listener
POST /hub
Description
Sets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver
information about its health state, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST
calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support multiple listeners. In this case
DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for registering a listener.
Request
POST /api/hub
Accept: application/json
{
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com"
}
Response
201
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /api/hub/42
{
    "id":"42",
    "callback": "http://in.listener.com",
    "query":""
}


 
Unregister listener
DELETE /hub/{id}
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub..
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful.
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a request for un-registering a listener.
Request
DELETE /api/hub/42
Accept: application/json
Response
204
Publish Event to listener
POST /client/listener
Description
Clears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub.
Provides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The
/client/listener url is the callback url passed when registering the listener.
Behavior
Returns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.
Usage Samples
Here’s an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example “EVENT TYPE”
should be replaced by one of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification
resources Models section) and EVENT BODY refers to the data structure of the given
notification type.
Request


 
POST /client/listener
Accept: application/json
{
    "event": {
        EVENT BODY
    },
    "eventType": "EVENT_TYPE"
}
Response
201
