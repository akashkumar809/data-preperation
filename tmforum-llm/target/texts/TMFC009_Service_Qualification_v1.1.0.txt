Description 
ODA 
Function 
Block 
Service 
Qualification 
TMFC009 Service Qualification component is responsible 
for checking and validating the availability of a 
service according to specified and configured 
business rules. It must identify at least one 
technical solution (RFSspec) available to deliver 
the service (CFSspec) and check the availability 
of all the resources types involved in this 
technical solution. No resources are allocated 
during Service Qualification. 
Service Qualification component has functionality 
that include checking service feasibility status 
and publishing or reporting service qualification 
result, but also calculated service delivery due 
date and identified need of an appointment at the 
customer site. 
Service Qualification can also be in charge of the 
cost calculation of the technical solution 
identified, when it cannot be determined at 
catalog design time (complex B2B services). This 
information will be used as an input to price 
calculation.

Service 
Configuration 
& Activation 
Service Configuration & Activation processes 
encompass allocation, implementation, configuration, 
activation and testing of specific services to meet 
customer requirements, or in response to requests 
from other processes to alleviate specific service 
capacity shortfalls, availability concerns or failure 
conditions.  Where included in the service provider 
offering, these processes extend to cover customer 
premises equipment. 
Responsibilities of the Service Configuration & 
Activation processes include, but are not limited to: 
• Verifying whether specific service designs 
sought by customers are feasible as part of pre-
order feasibility checks; 
• Allocating the appropriate specific service 
parameters to support service orders or requests 
from other processes; 
• Reserving specific service parameters (if required 
by the business rules) for a given period of time until 
the initiating customer order is confirmed, or until the 
reservation period expires (if applicable); 
• Implementing, configuring and activating specific 
services, as appropriate; 
• Testing the specific services to ensure the service is 
working correctly; 
• Recovery of specific services; 
• Updating of the Service Inventory Database to 
reflect that the specific service has been allocated, 
modified or recovered; 
• Assigning and tracking service provisioning 
activities; 
• Managing service provisioning jeopardy conditions 
• Reporting progress on service orders to other 
processes.

Note: refer to JIRA section and the need to identify a new Service Availability 
Check/Assessment activity at Service level, as part of L2 Service Configuration & 
Activation 
Note: previously identified processes at Resource level didn't exist anymore in eTOM 
23.5 and no equivalent has been found. A new Jira ticket is created. 
2.2. SID ABEs

Service Feasibility Checking 
provides checking based on the 
customer service location, service 
feasibility checks are done to 
assure the offering can actually be 
provided to the customer. This 
implies that the customer location 
is clearly established. Service 
feasibility checks are conducted 
via contract with the Service Order

3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events 
The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component.  
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs.  
• 
List of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate are listed in this section along with a list of the events which it 
may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for 
each defined event.

• 
identify a new Service Availability Check/Assessment activity at Service level, 
as part of L2 Service Configuration & Activation and able to provide all the 
expected results (feasibility status, service delivery due date,  need of an 
appointment at customer site, and cost of the technical solution when needed) 
• 
restore the Determine Resource Availability activity at Resource level. Initial 
definition was "This process investigates the ability to be able to satisfy specific 
service orders as a part of a feasibility check.  Where the Allocate & Install 
Resource processes are requested by a pre-feasibility resource order, or by the 
Design Resources processes, these processes determine whether the 
requested resources are available." 
5.3. SID 
• 
identify a new Service Qualification BE (if we want to register the result of the 
Service Availability Check/Assessment) 
5.4. Functional Framework 
• 
592 - Service Parameters Reservation should not be classified in Service 
Availability subdomain level 2, but rather in Service Configuration & Activation / 
Service Configuration 
• 
571 - Service Delivery Due Date calculation should be classified in Service 
Availability sub-domain level 2 and not in Service Order Initialization 
• 
Add a function to calculate the cost of a technical solution, for complex cases 
when it cannot be done at catalog design time. 
 
 


5.5. API 
• 
TMF645 - Service Qualification API: be able to receive as an answer not only 
the qualification result but also the calculated due date, the need of an 
appointment and the cost of the solution identified. 
5.6. Further resources
