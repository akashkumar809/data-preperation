 General Information 
This document contains the text of the Business Process Framework for context and more information please refer to “GB991 Core Frameworks Concepts
and Principles” guidebook. 
 Preface 
eTOM Business Process Framework 
The eTOM or Business Process Framework is a reference framework for categorizing all the business activities used by an enterprise involved in delivering
on-line Information, Communications and Entertainment services. This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process 
components or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to
show organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. 
The eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and
the starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional 
application for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an 
industry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with 
other enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required 
functions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. 
 Introduction 
This document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out 
this domain. 
The focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke
Product, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes. 
The decomposition starts with a top level process which is a Core Process that details the activity that takes place and describes all subsequent activities 
that occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then

below them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition
include another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   
Process Associations and IDs 
To aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. 
Processes have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: 
.b.x.c.d.e where  
 
b: 
This digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses 
to  
extended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   
x: 
Digit representing Domain  
c: 
Digit representing Level 2 process 
d: 
Digit representing Level 4 process 
e: 
Digit representing Level 5 process 
The unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. 


Typographic Conventions 
 
·  A Business Process is represented by a decorator in form of an arrow located to the top right. A red dot decorator with the initial TMF indicates that 
this is a TM Forum Business Process. The color yellow background hints to the business  layer.

• Provision of sales customer process infrastructure 
• Policy support and decision support knowledge for customers and customer interactions (including billing activities) 
•Maintaining inventories to support the customer data required by the FAB and CRM OS&R processes 
• Monitoring and reporting on the capabilities and costs of the individual Customer FAB processes 
• Longer-term trend analysis on customer FAB processes in order to establish the extent to which enterprise targets for these processes are being achieve
and/or the need for the processes to be modified. 
These processes support the operational introduction of new processes and infrastructure to support new and/or enhanced customer management 
capabilities and are responsible for conducting operations readiness testing and acceptance. They develop the procedures for the specific Fulfillment, 
Assurance and Billing processes and keep them up to date. After successful testing, these processes accept the new or enhanced process capabilities and
manage a full-scale introduction for general availability.

The purpose of the Support Customer Interface Management processes is to ensure that there is capability (for example, information, materials, systems 
and resource) so that the Customer Interface Management processes can operate effectively when a contact with a customer occurs. Examples are 
information on how to handle unusual requests based on temporary situations, systems needed to accept and track customer contacts, requests for the 
provisioning of additional resources where it has been identified that current levels will impact on timely contact handling. 
These processes are responsible for implementing generic and specific changes to customer interfaces. This support could be in updating agent scripts, 
IVR announcements, Web pages, etc. Customer Interface Support processes keep up to date all information concerning customers. 
These processes undertake trend analysis on customer contacts, e.g. type, frequency, duration, outcome.

Extended Description: 
Customer Experience Management (CEM) is the collection of processes a company uses to track, oversee and organize every interaction between its 
customers and the organization throughout the customer lifecycle process. The purpose of CEM processes is to create and drive a customer-centric cultur
to engender positive customer experience through journey design, experience perception, as well as tracking, overseeing and managing every interaction—
both direct and indirect—between the customer and the organization throughout the customer lifecycle. Furthermore, CEM processes put customers at the
center of marketing, sales and customer support in order to drive brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. 
The customer experience (CE) is comprised of a variety of elements, such as: cognitive, emotional, physical, sensorial, and social.  CE is based on two key
components. The first key component is the experience delivery in all direct interactions throughout the CSP's engagement and communication, products 
and/or services which apply in the above-described elements.  
The second key component is the measurement and management of the perception by the customer, including indirect interactions with the customer in 
which customer perception and knowledge play a strong role.  
CEM processes guide voice of the customer (VoC) programs to quantify customer sentiment about their experiences with a company; they provide support
for the adjustment of elements of the customer experience that generate knowledge to improve CE. CEM processes promote and support a 360-degree 
view of customers, with integrated, up-to-date data on customer accounts. 
The overall customer experience represents the full set of customer interactions across all customer journeys, it can be expressed as a set of qualitative 
and quantitative experience attributes. The set of attributes represents a calculated score on a scale from negative to positive Customer- Engagement-
Over-Time. The measured customer experience reflects and results from the collection of experiences from every customer. 
CEM optimizes the experience of the interactions with the customer in all customer-journey-lifecycles and maximizes the delivered outcome in terms of 
customer value and business value.
