Management 
TMFC040 The Product Usage Components 
provides standardized mechanisms 
for product usage management 
(creation, update, retrieval, import and 
export of a collection of usages) and 
Product Rating & Rate Assignment by 
assigning a value (monetary or other) 
to an event in the context of a product, 
a party (customers and partners) and

Description 
1.2.16 
L2 
Product Usage 
Management 
The Product Usage management 
processes encompass the functions 
required to guide, distribute, mediate, 
summarize, accumulate, and analyze 
Product Usage records. These processes 
may occur in real-time, near real-time (i.e. 
just at the end of the usage), or may be 
executed on a periodic basis. 
Based on Service Usage, this process aims 
at identifying Product Usage. For example, 
for a Video on Demand where you can 
watch a video as many time as you want 
during 72 hours, several Service Usages 
might have been tracked (each time the 
user watches the video) and only one 
Product Usage will be identified for all 
Service Usages in the 72 hours after the 
first watch. 
The guiding processes ensures that the 
Product Usage records used in the billing 
processes are appropriately related to the 
correct customer billing account and 
products. 
The Product Usage records are edited and 
if necessary reformatted (mediated) to 
meet the needs of subsequent processes. 
The billing event records may also be 
enriched with additional data during this 
process. 
1.2.16.1 
L3 
Product Usages 
The Enrich Product Usages processes will 
augment the product usage records by 
adding data to the records from sources 
such as customer, product,  or other 
reference data. 
1.2.16.1.1 L4 
Add Product Usage Data 
Add data to the records from sources such 
as customer, product, or other reference 
data to augment the product usage 
records. 
1.2.16.1.2 L4 
Assign Product Usage 
Price 
Assign a price to product usage without 
consideration of specific product or 
customer information. The assigned price 


Identifier

Description 
may be used to enrich the product usage 
record. 
1.2.16.2 
L3 
Guide and Assign 
Product Usages 
The Guide Product Usages processes 
ensure that the event records used in the 
billing process relate to the correct 
customer billing account and products.  A 
specific product usage record may be 
related to multiple customer billing 
accounts and subscribed products. 
Distribution of product usage records to 
other processes may also occur. 
1.2.16.2.1 L4 
Assign Product Usages 
Ensure that the Product Usages used in 
the billing process relate to the correct 
Product. 
1.2.16.2.2 L4 
Distribute Product Usage 
Distribute billing event records to other 
processes. 
1.2.16.2.3 L4 
Guide Product Usages 
Guide Product Usages process is in charge 
of identifying Product Usages based on 
Service Usages. 
For example, for a Video on Demand 
where you can watch a video as many time 
as you want during 72 hours, several 
Service Usages might have been tracked 
(each time the user watches the video) and 
only one Product Usage will be identified 
for all Service Usages in the 72 hours after 
the first watch. 
1.2.16.3 
L3 
Mediate Product Usages 
The Mediate Product Usages process edits 
and reformats the data record to meet the 
needs of a recipient application. 
1.2.16.3.1 L4 
Edit Product Usages 
Edit the data record for recipient 
applications. 
1.2.16.3.2 L4 
Reformat Product 
Usages 
Reformat the data record for recipient 
applications. 
1.2.16.4 
L3 
Report Product Usage 
Records 
The purpose of the Report Product Usage 
Record processes is to generate reports on 
Product Usage records based on requests 
from other processes. 
These processes produce reports that may 
identify abnormalities, which may be 
caused by fraudulent activity or related to 
customer complaints. 
Investigation of problems related to these 
product usage records is also part of this 
process. 
These processes also support other 
processes such as customer review of

product usages (pre-billing and post-
billing). 
1.2.16.4.1 L4 
Generate Product Usage 
Report 
Generate reports on product usage records 
based on requests from other processes. 
1.2.16.4.2 L4 
Investigate Product

Investigate problems related to product 
usage records. 
1.2.16.4.3 L4 
Support Product Usage 
Related Process 
Support other processes such as customer 
review of product usages (pre-billing and 
post-billing). 
1.2.17 
L2 
Product Rating & Rate 
Assignment 
The purpose of Product Rating & 
Assignment is to rate a value (monetary or 
other) to Product Usage or a set of Product 
Usages and assign the result to a Product 
and a Billing Account. The charge may be 
either a credit or a debit and can be 
handled either online or offline. 
Online charging is performed in real-time, 
requiring an authorization component 
which may affect how the service is 
rendered and enables an operator to 
provide prepaid services to its customers. 
Whereas offline charging is performed after 
the service is rendered and is not required 
to be done in real-time and generally 
relates to subscription based products. 
1.2.17.1 
L3 
Perform Rating 
Process responsible for calculating the 
value of a product usage or a set of product 
usages, before, during or after the 
rendering of the service, based on 
parameters of the request (type, quantity, 
etc.), parameters of the 
customer/subscriber (tariffs, price plans, 
accumulated usage, contracts, etc.) and 
other parameters (time-of-day, taxes, etc.). 
The same request maybe rated differently 
for different subscribers based on their 
purchased offers or agreements. 
1.2.17.2 
L3 
Aggregate Items For 
Rate Assignment 
This process is responsible for 
accumulating contributing items, which can 
be quantities, values (monetary or other) or 
both. Aggregation can occur over time or 
can be initiated to gather a “snapshot” of 
the items at a point in time. 
1.2.17.3 
L3 
Manage Customer 
Assignment 
HierarchyManaging the 
charging relationships 
among subscribers. 
Customer hierarchies are commonly used 
for corporate customers, family plans or 
other type of affinity groups. This process 
manages the assignment relationships 
among subscribers, e.g. sharing, inheriting 
or restricting balances, price plans and 


Identifier 
Level Business Activity Name 
Description 
discounts. Thereby assuring that a charge 
is added to or subtracted from the correct 
account balance. 
1.2.17.4 
L3 
Provide Advice of Rate 
The activity of Provide Advice of Rate (aka 
Advice of Charge) is responsible for 
providing advice on rates, in real-time or 
offline, an estimate or value of the rate for a 
specific usage request. The advice is 
usually based upon performing a full rating 
process for the request. 
1.2.17.5 
L3 
Apply Rate Level 
Discounts 
This process applies discounts to product 
prices at an individual product level. A 
discount may be expressed as a monetary 
amount or percentage, and modifies a price 
for a product. When a discount is 
expressed as a percentage, the 
discounting process determines the 
discount calculated in relation to the price 
for the product. 
The discount may be displayed as a 
separate entry on the bill or may be 
combined with the rate for the product to 
only show as one entry. 
Discounts may be a one-time event or may 
have some duration (days, months, life of 
product, etc.). Discounts may apply to a 
specific customer or be generally available 
based on selection of products (for 
example - bundles). Discounting structures 
may involve tiers, tapers, or thresholds.

4.  TMF OPEN APIs & Events 
 
The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component.  
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs.  
• 
List of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may 
consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each 
defined event. 
 
The Product Usage Management Component relate to usage and the API TMF635 
Usage Managment is in evolution as it mix concerns on product, service and resource 
levels. With version 5 of Open APIs, there is a major evolution of Usage APIs so that 
there will be a distinct usage API per Product, Service, and Resource: 
• 
TMF767 Product Usage 
• 
TMF727 Service Usage 
• 
TMF771 Resource Usage 
 These will replace the existing TMF635 Usage Management that will stop with v4 and 
not be migrated to v5. The Product Usage Management component relates to the 
usage on Product Level so in future iterations, the TMF767 will be included.
