Resource Inventory component is responsible for accounting for resources (all inputs - including stock, parts, assets, production components 
etc.) that are owned and/or held for allocation and/or use by the organization.
Resource Inventory component has functionality that includes inventory items creation, inventory organization, inventory search or filter, 
inventory monitoring and tracking, inventory control (organization, re-stock management etc.) and inventory auditing.
The minimum check to be performed at inventory items creation or update is the global consistency with related Resource Catalog information.

Resource Repository Updating function entails update of the resource Repository based on a provided collection of 
updates. The expectation is that the Repository is updated as requested, but no other side-effects are expected (e.g., 
creating an Sub Network Connection (SNC) in the network). This is a key point concerning this capability. The 
Repository update request can involve addition (new object), modification (change to an existing object) or deletion 
(removal of an object).

Retrieval
This function allows for client operations support (service assurance and billing systems) to retrieve part or all of the 
resource inventory known to the target OSS. This feature may allow the following selection criteria:
• retrieval of a specified set of one or more sub-trees
• exclusion or inclusion of specified object types from the selected sub-tree
• further filtering based on attribute matching
• retrieval of only the object instances that have been modified after a provided date and time
• For the selected objects, this feature may allow the client operations support (service assurance and billing systems) 
to specify what specific attributes and relationships shall be returned. This (the attributes and relationships to be 
returned) would be the same for all objects of the same type.

changes to the inventory:  Notifications concerning object creation, object deletion and attribute value changes to 
other systems.
• Single Entity Notifications – in this variation of the feature, each notification pertains to only one entity, e.g., an 
equipment instance
• Multi-entity Notifications – in this variation of the feature, a single notification may report on inventory changes for 
multiple entities.
• Notification Suppression – in this variation of the feature, each notification pertains to only one entity.
