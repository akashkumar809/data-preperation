Party 
Privacy 
The Party Privacy Profile ABE contains 
all entities used by the Party Privacy 
Management process for specifying 
• 
the information concerned by 
Privacy rules, 
• 
the Privacy rules themselves, 
• 
and the choices made by Parties for 
their own Privacy. 
 
 
*: if SID ABE Level 2 is not specified this means that all the L2 business entities must 
be implemented, else the L2 SID ABE Level is specified.  
Note: To trace the validation of the Party Privacy Profile by the Party, the Party Privacy 
ABE currently includes a PartyPrivacyAgreement BE, defined as a specialization of 
Agreement. But any of the complexity of the Agreement ABE is necessary here - no 
Agreement Items, no Agreement Authorization - only a global Approval is necessary.

3. TM Forum Open APIs & Events 
The following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: 
• 
List of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. 
• 
List of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component 
could require the usage of this set of required APIs. 
• 
List of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component 
may generate are listed in this section along with a list of the events which it 
may consume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for 
each defined event.

Note: TMF669 V5 will permit to manage a resource partyRoleSpecification too 
(useful to be able to associate a Party Privacy Profile Type to a Party Role 
specification). 
Note: TMF651 Agreement Management is not included as dependent API. Even if it is 
currently part of the resource model of the TMF644 Party Privacy API, a simplification 
is requested at TMF644 level, as in the Party Privacy ABE. 
3.3. Events 
The diagram illustrates the Events which the component publishes and the Events that 
the component subscribes to and then receives. Both lists are derived from the APIs 
listed in the preceding sections. 
The type of event could be: 
• 
Create : a new resource has been created (following a POST). 
• 
Delete: an existing resource has been deleted. 
• 
AttributeValueChange: an attribute from the resource has changed - event 
structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
InformationRequired: an attribute should be valued for the resource preventing 
to follow nominal lifecycle - event structure allows to pinpoint the attribute. 
• 
StateChange: resource state has changed. 
 


 
Note: Published events are the same for Privacy Management V4 and V5
