Executive Summary 
This Core Framework Concepts and Principles document sets the guidelines and best 
practices that help an enterprise  design, plan, implement, and govern the organization 
of its core building blocks. The structure of the document consists of four main 
sections: Concepts, Principles, Frameworks (Models) and Methods. 
Key concepts defined and described here provide the general ideas formalizing the 
Open Digital Architecture (ODA). The principles established can help manage an 
organization's enterprise architecture, with architectural assets such as the Business 
Process Framework (eTOM), Information Framework (SID), Functional Framework 
(FF) and Metrics etc.  These assets are pivotal to manage and operationalize the 
enterprise. Methods break down of the complex running of an enterprise into best 
practices, while the Models provide relational representation of the core business 
blocks. Altogether, the Framework provides the supporting "beams" to enable an 
organization to function according to an enterprise architecture blueprint, 
This document can be used as a business analysis tool with variations applied to 
different businesses (e.g. Service Provider). It can also be helpful when clarifying 
concepts to organize ideas. By leveraging a solid framework, as described in this 
document, the reader is able to capture "realistically" core business concepts of an 
organization and do this in a way that is tried and proven. 
 
 


Introduction 
The key concepts described in this document provide a common language and 
understanding for the architect, other associates and business stakeholders. The 
foundational CONTEXTS are used to establish the enterprise's building blocks. These 
building blocks are fundamental to the Open Digital Framework (ODF) as they define 
key concepts that are used throughout ODF. The core frameworks that make up the 
TM Forum ODF, include the Business Process Framework (aka eTOM), the 
Information Framework (aka as SID), and the Functional Framework (derived from the 
previous TAM). 
The key principles provide the rules and guidelines that govern the application of key 
concepts in the Open Digital Framework. The rules are designed to reflect the values 
and goals of a digital organization, while providing direction and guidance for decision-
making. These principles help to ensure consistency, alignment, and coherence across 
any architecture that aspires to align with the Open Digital Architecture (ODA).  
The section on method or methodology establish the processes and techniques that 
help an enterprise architect leverage the Open Digital Framework. They provide a 
structured and systematic approach to identify, analyze, design, and communicate the 
architecture. These methods or methodologies are here to help ensure quality, 
efficiency, and effectiveness of the target architecture of the organization.  
Models are the representations and artifacts that help the enterprise architect, design, 
document and communicate the architecture. In TM Forum, the Master Open Digital 
Architecture (MODA) is the definitive reference for ODA which provides the context and 
visualization of the structure, behavior, and relationships of the ODA business objects 
(architectural elements). Models help to ensure clarity, purpose, completeness and 
consistency of the architecture as they evolve through a maturation process which 
improves its reliability for TM Forum members.  
The adoption of the TM Forum core frameworks has the benefit of providing alignment 
with key industry standards and common ontology, in support of the enterprise's 
strategic and business goals. This can help boost both business and technical 
capabilities. All principles described in this document provide a foundational ground for 
the development of the enterprise's governance, rules and policies. 
 
 
 


1. CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS 
1.1. CONTEXTS 
Contexts provide an overarching structure for the frameworks for the classification and 
grouping of all business objects and architectural artifacts. There are two types of 
contexts; 1) Horizontal Contexts commonly known as "Domains", and 2) Vertical 
Contexts. 
Not all domains and vertical contexts are present in each of the frameworks  
1.1.1. 
HORIZONTAL CONTEXT (DOMAINS) 
Horizontal contexts are commonly known as Domains are of two kinds 1. Business 
Domains (shown in color in the diagram below) and 2. Non-Business Domains. 
The Business Domains represent areas of operations for delivery and management of 
the business. 
The Non-Business Domains represent collections of common objects and technical 
functions supporting the business areas. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1-1 Core Frameworks Domains 


The Market & Sales Domain represents roles, information and activities pertaining to 
marketing and leading to selling. The domain addresses market and sales strategy, 
capability delivery, lifecycle management and support of parties (e.g. individuals / 
organizations and things ) that move through the stages of selling (e.g., contact / lead / 
prospect). 
Marketing and Sales are two distinct and yet interconnected concepts in an enterprise 
with Marketing creating awareness, generating leads and building relationships with 
parties in the marketplace, and Sales focused on closing deals and generating 
revenue.  
1.1.1.2.  Product Domain 
The Product domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried out 
by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations and things) playing roles that are involved in 
the strategic planning, definition, development and operational aspects of Products that 
are conceived and offered for marketing and sales by the Service Provider.   
1.1.1.3.  Customer Domain 
The Customer domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried out 
by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that are involved in the 
management of and all types of contact with customers as they acquire, use, pay for 
and are supported for goods and services (i.e., products) that they obtain from an 
enterprise. Activities include: Strategy to Readiness (e.g., customer strategies, 
capabilities, customer lifecycle management) and Operations (e.g., customer 
relationship management , data, privacy, interactions, communications, orders, 
accounts, balances, service level agreements (SLAs), training, problems, cases, 
invoices, payments, disputes, collections, loyalty, performance, usage statistics, 
analytics and support). 
1.1.1.4.  Service Domain 
The Service domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried out 
by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing  roles that are involved in the 
strategic planning, definition, development, and operational aspects of Services that 
are used to realize Product offerings to the market. Activities include management of: 
strategies, capabilities, lifecycles, catalogs, inventories, installations, activations, 
problems, performance, guiding, mediation, usage statistics and support of customer-
facing services that are offered to customers and resource-facing services that are 
presented to resources by an enterprise. 
1.1.1.5.  Resource Domain 
The Resource domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried out 
by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that are involved in the 
strategic planning, definition, development and operational aspects of Resources (e.g., 
functions, applications, computing, networking and storage) that represent the 
infrastructure of an enterprise that are used to realize Services. Activities include 
management of strategies, capabilities, lifecycles, catalogs, inventories, topologies, 
installations, activations, alarms, problems, performance, mediation, usage statistics 
and support of Resources that are managed by an enterprise. 
1.1.1.6.  Business Partner Domain 
The Business Partner domain represents roles, activities, information and functions 
carried out by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that are involved in 
the strategic planning, definition, development, operational aspects and all types of 
contact with Business Partners (e.g., Suppliers, Partners, etc.) with which an enterprise 
collaborates in order to operate their business. Activities include management of 
Business Partner: strategies, capabilities, value propositions, relationships, profiles,

agreements (SLAs), training, problems, cases, invoices, payments, revenues, disputes, 
collections, loyalty, performance, usage statistics, analytics and support of Business 
Partners as they supply, acquire, use, support, purchase, pay for and are supported for 
goods and services (products) that they provide and / or obtain from an enterprise. 
1.1.1.7.  Enterprise Domain 
The Enterprise domain represents roles, activities, information and functions that are 
required to run and support a business. These concepts focus on both the setting and 
achieving of strategic corporate goals and objectives, as well as providing those 
support services that are required throughout an Enterprise. These concepts are 
sometimes considered to be the corporate functions and/or processes (e.g., Financial 
Management, Human Resources Management processes, etc.). Since Enterprise 
Management is aimed at general support within the Enterprise, they may interface as 
needed with almost every other process in the Enterprise, be they operational, 
strategy, infrastructure or product processes. 
1.1.1.8. Shared Domain 
The Shared domain is a specialized domain that is formalized for use in the Information 
Framework (SID) and the Functional Framework. This special domain represents 
information, functions and metrics that are not “owned by” any particular domain and 
are referenced or utilized from two or more other domains.  
1.1.1.9. Patterns Domain 
The Pattern domain is a specialized domain that is formalized for use in the Information 
Framework. It contains abstract ABEs not directly usable. These patterns need to be 
sub-classed to be used. 
1.1.1.10. Integration Domain 
The integration domain represents business-agnostic roles, information and activities 
(e.g., infrastructure, middleware, protocols) that support the integration and 
implementation of ODF concepts (e.g., business entities, business processes, 
functions, logical applications, interfaces, metrics, etc.). 
1.1.2. 
VERTICAL CONTEXT (LIFECYCLE STAGE) 
Development, Implementation and Operation of business entities and business 
artifacts related to the respective horizontal contexts. 
1.1.2.1. Vertical Context Area (Lifecycle Area) 
Vertical Context Area provide a classification of vertical contexts mostly relevant to the 
Business Process Framework (eTOM) and the Functional Framework; they represent a 
separation of concerns by dividing the enterprise lifecycle in two parts; 1) Strategy-to-
Readiness (includes 'Strategy Management', 'Capability Management', 'Business Value 
Development' and a shared part of 'Operations Readiness & Support'), and 2) 
Operations (includes a shared part of 'Operations Readiness & Support', 'Fulfillment', 
'Assurance', and 'Billing'). 
1.1.2.2. Vertical Context Stage (Lifecycle Stage) 
Vertical Context Stage provide a classification of vertical contexts as a means to further 
group them according to the two parts of the enterprise lifecycle, as described 
previously. 
 


 
 
Figure 1-2 Core Frameworks Contexts with Domains overlaid 
Strategy-to-Readiness Lifecycle context area  
Reference to section 1.1.2.1, the Strategy-to-Readiness Lifecycle context area 
represent the grouping of the lifecycle Context Stages: Strategy Management, 
Capability Management, Business Value Development, and part of Operations 
Readiness & Support. (see Figure 1.1).  
Strategy-to-Readiness" area identifies the business processes that can help 
organizations prepare for engagement with their markets. It includes transformation 
that readies people, processes and technology/platforms for operations. 
 
Strategy Management 
The Strategy Management vertical is a lifecycle stage that focuses on business objects 
that generate and manage specific business strategies, gain business buy-in, track 
effectiveness of the strategies, and optimize strategy required. 
Strategy Management is focused on the analysis and generation of strategies in 
support of all development and operations within the enterprise while establishing 
business commitment within the enterprise. 
Capability Management 
The Capability Management vertical is a lifecycle stage that focuses on the 
development and deployment of capabilities including all infrastructures for the delivery 
of products and services as well as support infrastructures and all business enablers. 
Framework artifacts in this vertical grouping identify requirements, design and develop 
new or enhanced capabilities and monitor their performance to adjust as required. 
 
 


The Business Value Development vertical grouping focuses on the definition, planning, 
design and implementation of value propositions and business promoting 
concepts/assets in the enterprise’s business portfolio. 
Frameworks artifacts in this vertical grouping create products, services, resources, 
business partner catalog information, sales and marketing campaigns and material and 
process Operations feedback to adjusts as required for Lifecycle management. 
Operations Lifecycle context area  
The Operations context area groups the lifecycle context stages: Fulfillment, 
Assurance, Billing, and part of Operations Readiness & Support. 
The Operations context area includes all the artifacts and building blocks that support 
customer operations, as well those that enable direct interactions with the customer. 
Such artifacts include both day-to-day and operations readiness and support. The 
“FAB” (or "OFAB") verticals in Operations are sometimes referred to as Customer 
Operations processes. 
 Operations Readiness & Support 
Operations Readiness & Support lifecycle stage is responsible for ensuring operational 
readiness and support of Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing. 
 Fulfillment 
Fulfillment lifecycle stage is responsible for initiation, instantiation and fulfillment of 
customer requests. 
Frameworks artifacts in this vertical grouping initiate fulfillment actions and convert 
requests (customer or business) into orders, to be delivered using the value offerings 
from the enterprise’s portfolio. This includes creation of instances of relevant artifacts in 
all domains necessary for the delivery of the value offerings. 
 Assurance 
This vertical context is responsible for running operations along with monitoring, 
measuring, analyzing and correcting to ensure the best performance, including Quality 
of Service.  Frameworks artifacts in this vertical context perform continuous status and 
performance monitoring of ongoing operations. They collect performance data and 
analyze them to identify potential problems and apply preventive and corrective 
maintenance without impacting the customer. 
The Assurance activities receive trouble reports and take necessary actions to ensure 
timely corrections. 
The Assurance activities ensure that overall performance and quality meets service 
level agreements, metric goals (KPIs) as well as reporting. 
 Billing 
This vertical context is responsible for translating business activities into revenue.  
Framework artifacts in this vertical context perform collection of appropriate usage 
records to determine charging and production of timely and accurate bills and supports 
payment of services and operation-related cost accounting. 
They provide pre-bill usage information and are processing customer payments and 
performing payment collections. 
 
 


1.2. BUSINESS CAPABILITY MAP 
(FUTURE WORK) 
1.3. BUSINESS PROCESS FRAMEWORK 
The Business Process Framework is a reference framework or model for the definition, 
classification and decomposition of Service Provider business process abstractions. A 
business process abstraction is a generalization of actual context-specific business 
processes.  So, rather than describing the process as it exists at company A or 
company B, or in one part of an organization versus another, the abstraction describes 
the essence of the process, and as such it can be used to "categorize" any or all of 
those context-specific processes that match the description. 
For more than 20 years, the TM Forum has developed the Business Process 
Framework in collaboration with its members, and has achieved industry-wide 
recognition, from the highest conceptual concepts, to the detailed process 
decomposition, taking into account real-world experience in the design, implementation 
and management of business processes in a service provider's environment and 
operations. It represents an ontology of business activities without prejudice to specific 
business process models or workflows realized in the context of specific enterprise 
strategies and market dynamics. 
1.3.1. 
Purpose 
The purpose of the Business Process Framework is to provide a standard process 
structure, terminology, and classification scheme for business processes in an 
enterprise. It offers an enterprise-wide discipline for the development of business 
processes that assure a consistent and reusable repository of processes in business 
process models.  
As a framework, it serves as a tool for discussion and agreement between providers 
and consumers which encourage clear definitions, convergence and understanding of: 
• 
Business requirements 
• 
Information agreements 
• 
Application contracts; and 
• 
shared data model specifications (exchanges between applications or 
systems)  
TM Forum BPF is a cross-industry process view that presents a common ontology for 
equipment suppliers, applications builders and integrators to define, build and operate 
systems and solution. 
1.3.2. 
Scope 
TM Forum Business Process Framework recognizes the different types of business 
processes in an enterprise. The scope of the Business Process Framework covers the 
three broad categorization of an enterprise business processes  - Core, Enabling and 
Supporting (also categorized in other ontologies as Operational, Management and 
Supporting respectively.) 
 
 


1.3.2.1. Core Process 
Core Process is a business process that constitute the core business and create the 
primary value stream of an enterprise. They are strategically important to the 
enterprise, and derive from the core competency of the business the enterprise is 
involved in -like taking and delivering orders from customers, defining and delivering 
products and services etc.   
1.3.2.2. Enabling Process 
Enabling Process, also known as management processes, is a business process that 
sets direction, like monitoring performance and executing plans for the enterprise.  
1.3.2.3. Supporting Process  
Support process is a business process that services the basic functions of the 
organization, like accounting, technical support, human resource etc.  
1.3.3. 
Conceptual View 
The conceptual view below shows the decomposition structure for a business process, 
from the top level to lower levels. At the highest level of representation is the "Business 
Process". The decomposition of the "Business Process" in directly supporting 
"Business Activity" starts at the level 3.     
 
Figure 1-3 Conceptional organization of TM Forum Business Process 
 
 


1.3.4.1. Business Process Model (Workflow) 
A business process model is a graphical representation of a business process or 
workflow and its related sub-processes. It defines the ways in which operations are 
carried out to accomplish the intended objectives of an organization. Business process 
modeling is the graphical representation of a company’s business processes or 
workflows. This is usually done through different graphing methods, such as the 
flowchart, data-flow diagram, etc. 
Refer to Section 4 in this document for more information about the methodologies 
used. See specific examples of Business Process Models in GB921F and GB921E 
where examples showcasing specific uses of Business Process Framework ontology to 
establish business process models that show E2E workflows depicting for "product 
management" and "order management" etc. 
1.4. INFORMATION FRAMEWORK 
The Information Framework is an abstract but formal / defined representation of 
business entities including their properties and relationships  that can be performed on 
them. A business entity is a thing of interest to the business, while its attributes are 
facts describe the entity. The formal definitions provide a business-oriented perspective 
to the information and data with a relationship between information and data 
representing interests between two business entities, or between a business entity and 
itself.  
The TM Forum Information Framework provides an industry reference for 
representation of concepts and the relationships, constraints, rules, and operations to 
specify information semantics for a chosen domain of discourse. It typically specifies 
relations between kinds of things but may also include relations with individual things.  
1.4.1. 
Purpose 
TM Forum Information Framework provides sharable, stable, and organized structure 
of information requirements or knowledge for domain contexts. As a framework, it 
serves the purpose of providing an enterprise with information definitions along with 
underlying relations between information exchanged by business processes. 
In combination with the Business Process Framework, the Information Framework 
offers a way to explain ‘how’ things are intended to fit together to meet a given 
business need.   
1.4.2. 
Scope 
The scope of the TM Forum Information Framework is to: 
• 
Establish an enterprises approach to Information management and 
governance. This includes the aggregating closely related business entities, 
and governing the relationships between business entities.   
• 
Describe the holistic approach to managing information 
created/read/updated/deleted by business processes through roles and metrics 
to transform information into business asset 
• 
Standardize the grouping of business entities into Aggregate Business Entities 
• 
Formalize Relationship between Business Entities

business entities 
 
1.4.2.1. Aggregate Business Entity 
An Aggregate Business Entity (ABE) is a well-defined set of information and operations 
that characterize a highly cohesive, loosely coupled set of business entities.  
In information modeling, an ABE is a way to further partition DOMAIN by grouping related 
Business Entities  (BEs) together. ABE can contain other ABE  or BE and can be 
considered as sub-domains. A given domain can contain anything from a few to over 
15 ABEs. 
1.4.2.2. Business Entity 
A Business Entity represents something of interest to the business that may be 
tangible things (such as a Customer), active things (such as a Customer Order), or 
conceptual things (such as a Customer Account).  Business entities are characterized 
by attributes and participate in relationships with other business entities. Business 
entity instances typically move through a well-defined life cycle.  
1.4.2.3. Attribute 
An attribute is a fact that describes a business entity. 
1.4.2.4. Relationship 
A relationship is an association of business interest between two business entities, or 
between a business entity and itself. 
 
1.4.3. 
Conceptual view  
At the highest level, the Information Framework is structured according to the ODA 
horizontal contexts (aka domains). Within each domain there is a high degree of 
cohesion.  Within each domain there is a high degree of cohesion between the 
identified business entities, and loose coupling between different domains. This 
enables segmentation of the total business problem and allows resources to be 
focused on a particular domain of interest. It is envisioned that the use of the resultant 
business entity definitions within each domain, when used in conjunction with the 
Business Process Framework, will provide a business view of the shared information. 
Within each domain, further partitioning of the information is achieved through the 
identification of Aggregate Business Entities (ABE’s).

1.5. FUNCTIONAL FRAMEWORK 
 
The Functional Framework is a collection (an ontology) of functions as defined in 
1.5.2.1  organized in a hierarchical fashion based on functional affinity.   This 
organization is based on domains, verticals, and aggregate functions (AFs). 
As the Functional Framework is an ontology, a given function is unique within the 
Functional Framework.  
1.5.1. 
Intended Uses 
Use by members (service providers, software providers, etc) can include: 
• 
Rationalization of systems 
• 
Governance 
• 
A common language for describing systems and system elements, 
• 
Basis for service provider to discuss with a software provider about solutions 
scope and functional coverage 
• 
Organize and rationalize systems elements, including applications, 
components, APIs, etc. 
 
TMF Use: 
• 
Bridge between business-level concepts (Processes, Business Capabilities) 
and systems-level concepts (API, Components) 
• 
Identify and describe the functions that are implemented by each component 
• 
Identify gaps and opportunities for coverage in definition of the Open APIs 
1.5.2. 
Scope 
The scope of the functional framework includes anything that the systems supporting 
the Telecom Industry may need to do. The Functional Framework scope is intended to 
include functionality of Business Support Systems (BSS), Operational Support 
Systems (OSS), Enterprise Systems, security and network elements within the 
Telecommunications industry. This includes the non-business technical aspects. 
1.5.2.1. Functions 
 
A function is a defined set of action(s) that a system is able to do in support of business 
or technical needs.  A function is defined as cohesive around a focused 
purpose.  Functions are typically characterized by action-oriented features, and often 
focus on elements of information.  Functions are implementation-agnostic (identifying 
what systems do as opposed to how). 
1.5.2.2. Aggregate Functions 
An aggregate function is a cohesive grouping of functions.  The description of each 
aggregate function should make clear on what basis functions are grouped together 
within that aggregate function, and should provide sufficient basis to determine whether 
a given function would belong within or outside of that Aggregate Function. 
 
 


Aggregate Function Level 1 
Aggregate Functions Level 1 contain Aggregate Functions Level 2 or functions. 
Aggregate Function Level 2 
Aggregate Functions Level 2 contain Functions.

2. PRINCIPLES 
2.1. Shared  
S-01 
One framework organizes all ODA Core objects 
Statement 
A shared framework is a common language and structure that enables 
different parts of the Open Digital Architecture to organize concepts 
that work together effectively towards same goals, by improving 
communication and collaboration, and by reducing confusion and 
misunderstandings. 
Rationale 
• 
Improve communication and collaboration between different 
parts of the  
enterprise. 
• 
Better decision-making with context based on bounded zones / 
blocks. 
• 
Provide a common language and structure for different 
foundations of ODA to work together effectively. 
• 
Ensure producers and consumers are working towards the 
same goals with reduced confusion and misunderstandings.  
Implications 
• 
Provide a common language and structure for Open Digital 
Architecture foundation assets that serve as primitives for 
enterprises to plan, transform and operate. 
• 
Reduce confusion and misunderstandings between different 
departments or teams, and help to ensure that business 
objects grouped are altogether supporting same goals. 
• 
Improve communication and collaboration between different 
parts of an enterprise, which can lead to better decision-
making and more effective problem-solving. 
 
S-02 
Release and Publication Status  
Statement 
The shared release and publication status for all ODA Core assets 
shall be one of:  
• 
Released 
• 
Preliminary 
• 
Draft 
• 
Not Fully Developed 
Rationale 
• 
Applying the same lifecycle statuses across all elements 
promotes consistency, predictability, and transparency. It 
allows for better tracking, management, and understanding of 
the state of each element at any given time. 
Implications 
• 
Ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the 
status of each element. 


• 
Facilitates better planning and resource allocation based on 
the lifecycle status. 
• 
Promotes accountability as each status requires specific 
actions and responsibilities. 
• 
Enhances efficiency by standardizing the process of updates 
and releases. 
 
S-03 
Business-first understanding 
Statement 
All business processes, information models, and software functions 
shall be designed with simplicity and a business-first approach. They 
should be easily understandable and directly contribute to the 
achievement of business goals. 
Rationale 
Simplicity leads to better understanding, efficient execution, and easier 
maintenance. A business-first approach ensures that all processes, 
models, and functions are aligned with the enterprises objectives and 
contribute to its success. 
Implications Keep models simple and understandable by Business first, and then 
technology personas. This will: 
• 
Facilitate clear communication across all levels of the 
enterprise. 
• 
Enhance efficiency by reducing complexity in processes, 
models, and functions. 
• 
Ensure alignment of all operations with the enterprises 
business goals. 
• 
Promotes a culture of simplicity and clarity in the enterprise.  
 
2.2. Framework Specific

Business Capability 
(FUTURE WORK) 
2.2.2. 
Business Process Framework 
BPF-01 
Nature of the Business Process Framework 
Statement 
The Business Process Framework consists of a decomposition 
structure and taxonomy of process abstractions representing business 
process elements (i.e. groups of processes, activities and tasks) that a 
Service Provider needs to manage. 
Rationale 
The Business Process Framework is intended to be comprehensive - 
all of a service  
provider's processes, activities and tasks should fit within the Business 
Process Framework. 


Implications 
• 
The process abstractions of the business process framework 
are categorizations of the context-specific processes that exist 
within service providers. 
The Business Process Framework provides a comprehensive 
catalog of such process abstractions relevant for a Service 
Provider. It provides an industry agreed standard consisting of 
process decomposition structure, terminology, and 
classification scheme of process elements across multiple 
levels of decomposition. 
The process elements of the Business Process Framework can be 
used to create consistent process flows (however, they are not 
business process flows themselves) 
The business drivers for adopting and using the framework can be 
summarized according to the following: 
o The need to standardize the language for describing 
business processes  
o The need to standardise tasks on which business 
process flows will be based 
o The need to understand the elements that make up 
each business process. 
o The need to understand the objectives associated with 
each business processs 
  
 
 
BPF-02 
Standards for Organizing Business Processes - Naming, 
Decomposition and Traceability 
Statement 
A business process element shall be named and decomposed 
according to the following pattern or structure. Naming: 
• 
Noun verb (for a business process grouping) 
• 
Verb noun (for underlying activities and tasks that support the 
business process) 
Decomposition:   
• 
The Business Process Framework is decomposed from 
notional Level 0 to more granular levels  
• 
The Levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 (and some of levels 5 and 6) are 
addressed so far.  
Rationale 
This prevents any confusion and establishes a unified level setting for 
business processes. Because the Business Process Framework is a 
decomposition model, the lower  
levels of the decomposition can be traced back to the higher levels. 
As a classification or taxonomy of Process Elements, at Level 0 the 
elements are classified into S2R (Strategy to Operations) and 
Operations.  Lower Levels are formed by decomposition with each 
Process Element occurring once only


g

g
Decomposition and Traceability 
Implications 
• 
Achieve consistency in naming and decomposition following a 
consistent pattern 
• 
Ensure the goal is implied in the name of the business process 
with relevance primary stakeholders. 
• 
Ensure the name resonates with industry use or advances 
industry consensus about the primary role the business 
process plays. 
 
BPF-03 
Classification of Business Processes 
Statement 
All business processes shall be classified as one of the following 
types: 
• 
Core Process 
• 
Enabling Process 
• 
Supporting Process  
Rationale 
Enable organizations to identify important business actions that impact 
their core business, enabling the management of resources and the 
efficiency of support.  
This includes cost reduction and resource allocation. 
Implications 
• 
Enable enterprises to understand and manage business 
processes more effectively. 
• 
Identify levels of importance of business processes and 
allocate associated resources accordingly. 
• 
Help to improve efficiency and reduce costs of operationalizing 
business processes, while also ensuring that the enterprise is 
focused on its core business goals. 
 
BPF-04 
Definition of Business Processes 
Statement 
All business processes should be clearly defined in terms of their 
structure, constituents, roles and purpose.  
Rationale 
Enable organizations to ensure their business processes are 
consistent and complete.  
Implications 
• 
A business process has characteristics that include goals, 
inputs, outputs and business outcome. 
• 
A well identified, scoped and articulated business process must 
provide clarity on the resources underpinning its activities. 
• 
Organizations should be able to realize goals linked to 
business processes by formalizing them in specific sequence 
to realize value.  
 


y
Statement 
Each Business Process element should be associated with one (or 
more) Information Framework ABE(s). 
Rationale 
To be consistent, processes must be related to specific information 
elements.   
Implications 
• 
Business processes do not exist in isolation. Processes require 
information from other processes, and they in turn provide 
information to other processes.  
• 
Dependencies (or associations) between processes occur 
when an activity requires information from another activity. 
Process dependencies are related to the entities and attributes 
required by the business area.  
 
BPF-06 
Business Process Ownership 
Statement 
A business process shall always have a “Process Owner” who acts as 
the person or instance that has the highest level of responsibility and 
decision-making with respect to the process; such person or instance 
is designated as being accountable for the outcome that results from 
the execution of the process. 
Rationale 
Responsibility can be shared amongst individuals involved in the 
execution of a particular process, however, accountability–which 
designates ultimate responsibility and ownership of the process–refers 
to the unique instance or person who is in charge of the entire 
process, and therefore accountable for the outcome resulting from the 
execution of such process, this instance or person is designated as 
the “accountable” party and it is in general referred to as “the Owner” 
of the process. 
Implications 
• 
"Shared responsibility is no accountability”;  
• 
a business process is always overseen and “groomed” by its 
owner who is the person or instance ultimately responsible for 
the outcome of the execution of the process;  
• 
failure to designate or have implicitly a process owner or 
accountable party would result in lack of commitment or 
accountability in the event that the process is not delivering the 
expected outcome; likewise, if the process is delivering 
excellent results, it is most often the process owner (or 
accountable instance) that gets glorified. 
 
BPF-07 
Continuously Optimize Business Processes 
Statement 
New information systems will be implemented after business 
processes have been analyzed, simplified or otherwise redesigned as 
appropriate. 
Rationale 
• 
There is no real “value” in applying technology to old, inefficient 
business processes. 
• 
Core processes will be more streamlined efficient and cost-
effective


y
• 
Core processes, activities, tasks and associated business rules 
will be well understood and documented. 
• 
Reduces the total cost of ownership. 
Implications 
• 
Need to have an agreed upon continuous business process 
improvement activity. 
• 
New technology will be applied in conjunction with business 
process review. 
• 
Business processes must be optimized to align with business 
drivers. 
• 
Additional time and resources will have to be invested in 
analysis early in the systems' lifecycle. 
• 
Organizational change will be required to implement 
reengineered work processes. 
• 
May require regulatory or legislative change. 
 
BPF-08 
A core processes has a unique position in the process framework 
Statement 
All Level-2 (L2) business processes have a specific, unique position in 
the process framework, their position depends on the purpose, nature, 
and role of the process within the enterprise. As a general rule, each 
position is determined by the intersection between the vertical 
grouping and the horizontal domain to which the process belongs in 
the process framework. In general, L2 process belong to one unique 
vertical and one unique horizontal domain; however, there are some 
exceptions in which some L2 processes can span more than one 
vertical, these are commonly referred to as cross-functional or 
transversal core processes. 
Rationale 
The Business Process Framework was created and evolved from two 
different but complementary models: 1) An Enterprise Architecture 
layering model (based on a construct of hierarchical architecture 
layers) which originated with the early concepts underpinning the TMN 
model; and 2) An enterprise lifecycle structure consisting of vertical 
groupings (aka lifecycle stages) which originated in the early concepts 
associated with the FCAPS model. Such design resulted in a matrix of 
X and Y positions, each position characterized by a specific couple 
‘vertical/horizontal’, representing a unique stage in the enterprise 
lifecycle and a unique horizontal architecture domain; as a general 
rule, each position hosts several L2 processes, therefore, each L2 
process belongs to one unique vertical and one unique horizontal 
domain; however, some L2 processes span more than one vertical, 
these are referred to as cross-functional or transversal processes, they 
are considered exceptions to the previous rule, and therefore they are 
prone to change in the future as the framework continues to evolve. 
Implications Level-2 (L2) processes play a vital role in the lifecycle of the 
enterprise, each L2 process represents a grouping of activities and 
tasks that deliver the intended business outcomes for each part of the 
enterprise process framework, as such, L2 processes are designed

which are determined by the position of the process in the framework 
i.e. vertical grouping(s) and horizontal domain to which the process 
belongs. In the past, common process models were designed 
contextless–that is–core processes were monolithic elements 
decomposed into smaller granularity elements, but without being 
directly related or mapped to any specific context i.e., didn’t belong to 
any particular enterprise lifecycle or architecture domain e.g., Product, 
Service, Resource, etc. The Business Process Framework (eTOM) 
brought along an innovative classification and modelling of the 
business processes across the enterprise, by adding horizontal 
domains and vertical Lifecycle stages which provided a meaningful 
architectural context. 
 
BPF-09 
Business Processes lead on architecture requirements 
Statement 
Business processes represent an implementation of the business 
requirements sourced from the organization’s strategy and business 
intent, as such, business processes embody the required support and 
full alignment with the business to ensure business operations and 
their goals are achieved. 
Rationale 
Business processes embody the activities and tasks that need to be in 
place, to enable and support successfully the operation of the 
enterprise, business processes are in alignment with the goals of the 
business, as such, they translate business intent and required 
business capabilities into “implied” functional requirements that are 
further communicated to the functional, application and technology 
architectures–as subordinates of the Business Architecture–for 
implementation and execution through either manual or automated 
support, or a combination of both. 
Implications Business processes play a central role in the business architecture, as 
they define altogether the fabric of activities and tasks that are needed 
to effectively support and run the business. It is a vital principle to 
always ensure an optimal alignment between the enterprise business 
goals, and the capabilities available to support and achieve those 
goals.

Information Framework (Kevin/Cecile- September 7) 
#INF-01 
Coupling of ABEs to Business Processes 
Statement 
An ABE shall be created by one business process (denoted primary 
process). 
If a one-to-one coupling is not achievable, an ABE shall be coupled to 
associated 
core processes with clear separation of accountability for information 
lifecycle management. 
Rationale 
A single primary process should manage the complete life cycle of an 
ABE, creating, updating, and deleting entity instances contained within 
the ABE. 


g
Implications If there is more than one process creating an ABE, this suggests these 
are overlapping processes, or the scope of the ABE is too broad. 
 
#INF-05 
ABEs, Core Entities and Dependent Entities 
Statement 
There should be one single core business entity in an ABE in general 
(there are some exceptions however), in most cases the core entity 
has the same name as its parent ABE. 
Rationale 
A well-defined Aggregate Business Entity (ABE) consists of a set of 
information that characterizes a highly cohesive, loosely coupled set of 
business entities, which have loose relationships with items outside 
the ABE. 
Implications A core business entity is an entity that is not dependent upon any 
other entity within the ABE. Likewise, generally, non-core business 
entities are dependent on the core business entity. And do not need to 
have an 'ID' attribute, given they can be reached by navigation from 
the core business entity. 
 
#INF-06 
Principles for ABE Placement in Shared Domain versus Patterns 
Domain 
Statement 
ABEs and related BEs will be placed in Shared when: 
1. One or more "Core" Business Entities are "Concrete", AND 
2. Business Entities must be used in more than one domain 
without modification or subclassing (e.g. - Party) 
A core entity is a main entity (not a subclass) 
ABEs and related BEs will be placed in the Patterns Domain when: 
1. All "core" business entities are abstract. 
2. Business entities, attributes, and/or relationships are inherited 
by concrete business entities within other ABEs. 
Rationale 
To be completed  
Implications To be completed  
 
#INF-07 
Principles for ABE Placement in Patterns Domain 
Statement 
ABEs and related BEs will be placed in the Patterns Domain when 
1. All "core" business entities are abstract. 
2. Business entities, attributes, and/or relationships are inherited 
by concrete business entities within other ABEs. 
Rationale 
To be completed  
Implications To be completed  
 


Statement 
The Information Model is built on the principle of "single 
inheritance".  Not all business entities need to be "rooted", but a given 
class/business entity can only inherit from one entity. 
Notes: 
• 
Must verify that this is true 
• 
One reason for not doing multiinheritence is because it can be 
a challenge to 'implement' 
Rationale 
To be completed  
Implications To be completed

Association Directionality 
Statement 
Within the SID model, an association is assumed to be bi-directional. 
Rationale

Implications 
To be completed  
 
#INF-10 
Ennumerations 
Statement 
Generally, the Information model does not use 
enumerations.   Attributes with some number of given values is 
handled as follows: 
• 
Attribute declared to be of type String 
• 
Possible values are specified in the attribute description

2.2.4. 
Functional Framework  
Please note! 
We are currently in the process of redefining the principles of the Functional 
Framework. This is an iterative process and we plan 
to remove the current principles and add new one as they are identified discussed and 
approved to be included. 
 
Previous List of Principles, will be curated in next version: 
 
#FUF-01 
Nature of the Functional Framework 
Statement 
The Functional Framework is a taxonomy of systems* capabilities that 
are relevant to the ecosystem of communications service providers. 


Systems capabilities are what systems are able to provide, defined 
independent of the context of specific processes, organizations, 
applications and implementations. 
*Software and/or hardware 
Rationale 
It is the intent that all functions of the Service Provider can be 
supported by (i.e., are able to fit within) the Functional Framework 
functions.  
Each function has a detailed description that reflects its purpose. 
Implications The Functional Framework is a catalog of functions/functionalities that 
are relevant for a Service Provider.  
The Functional Framework specifies functions along with their 
descriptions and are grouped in alignment with the Business Process 
Framework process structure.  
The functions Process Elements are activity-based, and the  
Business Process Framework is thus an activity-based process 
decomposition model. 
 
#FUF-02 
Definition of Functional Framework Functions [TO BE EDITED BY KAJ 
/ DONE] 
Statement 
A function is defined to produce one specified result.  
Functions are defined at such granularity level that the principle of 
separation of concerns is considered and when activated the 
function’s result will be accepted without exceptions. 
Each Functional Framework functions should be unique for each 
described functionality. 
Rationale 
The functions of the Functional Framework shall be trusted to be 
unique.  
The function shall specify a functionality without exceptions.  
Implications A function specifies the action it will perform.  
A list of functions can be used to specify a collective functionality of 
e.g. a component or application, without the risk of conflicting functions 
or overlapping functionality. 
 
#FUF-03 
Information Ownership Functions 
Statement 
In Domains that are business context specific, (Market_Sales, 
Customer, Product, Service, Resource and Business Partner) the 
functions belonging to these domains have a direct responsibility type 
of relationship (Create, Update and Delete) with Information 
Framework elements. 
Functions in the Shared Domain can be used in different contexts, 
which means that mapping to Information Framework elements will 
differ depending on where the functions are used. 


Rationale 
A fundamental role of functions is to manage information. Based on 
the function's purpose it is related to specific information elements.   
Implications Functions are the primary way to manage information and acts on 
behalf of processes and other functions to manage the information of 
their ownership. 
Functions require information from other functions, and they in turn 
provide information to other functions, but each function should have 
unique impact on its related information. 
 
#FUF-04 
Function Ownership 
Statement 
A function shall always have a “Function Owner” that acts as the entity 
or instance that, from an implementation point of view, is responsible 
for the direct outcome that results from the execution of the function. 
Rationale 
Responsibility can be shared amongst entities or instances of parties 
involved in the specification and execution of a particular function, 
however, accountability–which designates utmost responsibility and 
ownership of the parent process–refers to the unique instance or 
person who is ultimately liable for the outcome of the process, the 
process in turn delegates responsibility to the function in charge for the 
execution of the task(s) involved. Depending on the implementation 
scenario, the function can be owned by the delegating process itself, 
or by a different entity or party (e.g., outsourcing scenario). 
Implications "Shared responsibility is no accountability.” 
A function is always overseen and “groomed” by its owner who is the 
person or entity ultimately responsible for the outcome of the 
execution of the function. If a function owner or accountable party has 
not been formally specified or designated, the result could be a lack of 
commitment or accountability in the event that the function is not 
delivering the expected outcome; likewise, if the function is delivering 
the expected result, it is the function owner, or the accountable 
process owner, or both who get credit for the successful outcome. 
ADD TEXT ON QUALITATIVE ASPECTS 
#FUF-05 
Continuously Optimize Functions 
Statement 
New functions will be designed and implemented continuously as 
information systems and technology develop. 
Functional Framework functions will continuously be analyzed, 
simplified, or otherwise redesigned as appropriate to follow the 
development. 
Rationale 
For the management of the functionality of a corporate’s system 
infrastructure the functions must be continuously improved, and the 
number of functions expanded. 
Functions will be used or referred to in many systems architectures. 
To have access to up-to-date function specifications is of great value. 


y
For systems architectures with high flexibility to improve individual 
functions (e.g., ODA Components) the functional framework and the 
functions are expected to be updated in a dialog with the industry. 
For more stable systems the Functional Framework function and the 
functions are expected to be a source of reference and inspiration.   
Implications There is a need to have an agreed governance of continuous function 
improvement activity.  
New technologies will influence the Functional Framework and its 
functions. 
Functions must be optimized to align with business development, 
architecture development and technology development. 
Additional time and resources will have to be invested in analysis early  
in the systems lifecycle. 
Organizational change will be required to implement reengineered 
systems with optimized functions.

3. THE FRAMEWORKS 
3.1. Business Process Framework 
The Business Process Framework (also known as eTOM) is an operating model 
framework for Communication & Digital Service Providers (CSPs & DSPs) in the 
communications and digital services industries. The model describes the required 
business processes of service providers and defines key elements and how they 
should interact. 
The Business Process Framework is a standard maintained by the TM Forum, an 
association for service providers and their ecosystem partners in the communications 
and digital services industries. It is a hierarchical classification scheme with 
descriptions of the key business processes required to run a service-focused business. 
It is also a comprehensive, industry-agreed, multi-layered view of the key business 
processes required to run an efficient and agile digital enterprise. It provides a common 
language for use across departments, systems, partners and suppliers, reducing cost 
and risk of system implementation, integration and procurement. 
The eTOM's business-oriented view of the enterprise is useful for planners, managers, 
strategists and others who need to view the enterprise in business terms, without 
immediate concern for the nature of the way that these business needs are organized 
or automated within the business. Therefore, eTOM emphasizes issues such as 
process structure, process components, process interactivity and the business roles 
and responsibilities to which these relate. 
The Business Process Framework (eTOM) is a reference framework for categorizing 
all the business activities that a service provider will use in a structured manner that 
allows these to be addressed at various levels of detail. The processes are grouped by 
domains and vertical category context and are decomposed starting from high level 
core, supporting and enabling processes that depict key activities succeeded by lower 
level unique task activities. 
eTOM serves as the blueprint for process direction and provides a reference point for 
internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working 
agreements with other enterprises. 


 
Figure 3-1: The Level 2 map of the currently published Business Process Framework 
(Please refer to tmforum.org/moda for an up-to-date view)    


3.2. Information Framework 
The Information Framework (also known as the SID) provides an information/data 
reference model and a common information/data vocabulary from a business entity 
perspective.  This 'business view' model uses the concepts of domains and aggregate 
business entities to categorize business entities, reducing duplication and overlap. 
Based on data affinity concepts, the categorization scheme is necessarily layered, with 
each layer identifying in more detail the “things” associated with the immediate parent 
layer.  
The Information Framework's business-oriented view of the enterprise is useful for 
software engineers, data modelers, enterprise architects as well as business architects 
and strategists due to the fact that an information model identifies the key data entities 
in business terms, serving as a bridge between the business and technical areas of a 
business. 
 
Figure 3-2: The currently published High Level Information Framework (Please refer to 
tmforum.org/moda for an up-to-date view)    


3.3. Functional Framework 
The Functional Framework is a collection of Functions described as automated 
(computerized) activities, provided for human/machine usage through User Interfaces 
or machine usage through Integration Services.  
The Functional Framework Function is defined to produce one specified result. The 
ambition is that Functional Framework Functions are defined at such granularity level 
that when activated the resulting outcome will be completely accepted. For Functions 
with a description listing more than one sub-function all sub-functions are expected to 
be performed at every activation. 
The granularity level shall also allow only one Function in the Functional Framework for 
each described functionality. See the figure below for the current high level map of the 
Functional Framework Functions.

refer to tmforum.org/moda for an up-to-date view) 
 
 


4. METHODOLOGY 
This section outlines methodologies for using the frameworks. While the framework 
provides a singular and definitive structure with rules, concepts and principles 
to plan or decide assets for the enterprise's information systems, methodologies for 
modelling target systems and solutions vary and thus this section will highlight relevant 
methodologies that the frameworks support.  
4.1. Business Process Modelling methodology  
Business Process Modelling (BPM) is a technique to represent, analyze and improve 
the activities and workflows of an organization. It helps to identify the goals, inputs, 
outputs, roles, resources, rules and interactions of each process (including activity and 
tasks). 
By creating a visual and formal representation of the business processes, modelling 
enables a better understanding of the current state and the potential for improvement. 
Modelling also facilitates communication and collaboration amongst the stakeholders, 
such as managers, employees, customers, suppliers and partners (in an ecosystem 
management play). 
Benefits BPM is that it can support the automation, adaptation and governance of the 
business processes. Automation will use software and/or hardware to perform tasks 
that would otherwise require human intervention. Automation can increase efficiency, 
accuracy and consistency of the processes, as well as reduce costs and errors. 
Adaptation refers to the ability to change or modify the business process models in 
response to changing needs, demands or opportunities. Adaptation can enhance 
flexibility, agility and innovation of the organization, as well as enable it respond to/or 
lead markets. Governance refers to the establishment and enforcement of standards, 
policies and rules that guide the execution and evaluation of the processes. 
Governance can ensure quality, compliance and accountability of the organization. 
To achieve these benefits, business process modelling leverage standardized catalog 
of processes, activities and tasks very well scoped, named, defined/described and 
attributed to their goals. To realize these benefits in practice, BPMs require the use of 
standards that define the syntax, semantics and notation of the business process 
models. Standards are important because they enable interoperability, compatibility 
and integration amongst different entities, tools, systems and platforms that support the 
modelling, execution and monitoring of business processes. Standards also require 
and ensure consistency, clarity and completeness of the models, as well as facilitate 
their validation, verification and testing. Some examples of standards for BPMs are 
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), Business Process Execution 
Language (BPEL) and Unified Modeling Language (UML).  
• 
Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN): This is the most widely used 
and accepted standard for BPM. It uses a set of graphical elements to depict 
events, activities, gateways, flows, pools and lanes in a process diagram. 
BPMN can capture complex and dynamic processes with multiple participants, 
roles and scenarios. BPMN also supports the execution of process models 
using Business Process Management Systems (BPMS).   


 
Figure 3-1 Example of BPMN (reference source:  BPMN 2.0 Business Process 
Toolbox Pages | Enterprise Architect User Guide (sparxsystems.com)) 
 
• 
Unified Modeling Language (UML): This is a general-purpose modeling 
language that can be used for various domains, including software engineering, 
systems engineering and business analysis. UML offers 14 types of diagrams 
to model different aspects of a system or process, such as use case diagrams, 
activity diagrams, sequence diagrams and state machine diagrams. UML is 
more suitable for modeling the detailed logic and behavior of a process, rather 
than the overall flow and structure. UML also requires more technical 
knowledge and skills to use effectively.   
• 
Flowchart: This is a simple and intuitive way to model a process using basic 
shapes and arrows to show the steps and decisions in a workflow. Flowcharts 
are easy to create and understand, but they have limitations in expressing 
complex and parallel processes, as well as roles and responsibilities of different 
actors. Flowcharts are also not standardized, which means they can vary in 
style and meaning across different contexts and tools.  
Other models are:  
• 
Event-driven Process Chain (EPC): This is a BPM methodology that uses 
events, functions, connectors, roles and information objects to model a process. 
EPC focuses on the triggers and outcomes of each process step, rather than 
the activities themselves. EPC is often used in conjunction with SAP software to 
design and implement enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. 
• 
Lifecycle Modeling Language (LML): This is a BPM methodology that uses 
six core elements to model a process: stakeholders, value propositions, 
actions, measures, decisions and loops. LML emphasizes the value creation 
and delivery aspects of a process, as well as the feedback loops that enable 


collaborative. 
• 
Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM): This is a BPM 
methodology that uses subjects, messages, states and transitions to model a 
process. S-BPM views each process participant as an autonomous subject that 
communicates with other subjects through messages. S-BPM allows for 
distributed and dynamic process execution, as well as adaptive and agile 
process design. 
 
TM Forum's BPF provides the standards for identifying the composition of business 
processes, a common library of tasks and activities performed with objectives that 
dovetail the overarching goal of a business process, as well as an attempt to organize 
them into a formalized framework of the Open Digital Framework. Examples of using 
the TM Forum BPF can be found in GB921B. 
4.2. Information Modelling methodology 
The information framework provides a 'data' view of the enterprise.  The SID identifies 
real-world objects of interest, models them as entities (or classes).  The framework 
then identifies important class characteristics, or "attributes".   Definitions are provided 
for both the class and the attributes.   In addition, relationships between these classes 
are identified and modeled as well. 
4.3. Functional Framework  Modelling methodology 
To be added  
 
 
 


5. META MODELs 
This meta-model is the structure of the MODA asset interrelationships as they have 
been documented in the system-of-record.  It has not been formally ratified, hence we 
refer to it as "de facto".
