The Business Process Framework eTOM comprises of functional process \nstructures, i.e. Market/Sales, Product, Customer, Service, Resource and Engaged Party processes. \nThe Process Model discussed in this paper complements eTOM by providing an end-to-end \nprocess flow driven view to the different functional groupings. Within the TM Forum Business \nProcess Framework eTOM Levels 1\u20133 already exists as a standard. However, the implementation \nof this standard can be facilitated through the further enhancement in terms of process flows at \nLevel 3 as demonstrated in Figure 1. Therefore, this document gives clear recommendations on \nhow to develop the core Customer Centric, Network and Product process flows which are \ncompliant with eTOM Level 1\u20133. \nThis document is an Application Note, aiming to document an approach based on industry \nexperience that sets out a structure for considering how these flows can be organized against the \noverall business needs, and provides a number of process flows that address these needs. Note \nthat, as an Application Note, this material should not be read as normative \u2013 i.e. a single \nstandardized approach \u2013 but rather as a representative mechanism that provides a useful base for \nothers to build on. Other approaches, with different organizational structures which may lead to \nother process flows, are also possible. It is the goal of work like this to assist convergence for the \nindustry, but not to impose a single approach, where there are other variations and alternatives \nthat make sense. \nThe original process flows were first published in April 2011 (Release 9.1). Since then the original \nprocess flows have been redesigned and updated as part of the development of the Releases 13.5, \n15.0 and 16.0."}

One of the most renowned and \ndiscussed approaches for improving competitiveness in the last decade is Business Process \nManagement. Business Process Management is about improving organizational performance \nthrough the definition, implementation and management of operational, as well as enterprise \n(management) processes. \nOver the last years, customer satisfaction has become one of the most critical factors to success in \nan environment which is characterized by growing market transparency, increasing demands from \nthe customers, and reduced customer loyalty. By improving customer loyalty, existing turnover \ncan be secured or even increased \u2013 either through growth in terms of turnover per existing \ncustomer, or through new customers. The key to success is, however, not purely a case of clever \ncustomer loyalty programs, but also the consistent orientation of the core processes towards \ncustomers\u2019 requirements. The benefit of marketing measures will be short term if customer \norientation is not taken seriously in terms of the company\u2019s interaction with the customers. \n \n \nFigure 1.  Process Model and eTOM Flows \n  \nWithin this context, the definition of efficient and customer-oriented business processes is a \ncrucial success factor. The Business Process Framework eTOM comprises of functional process \nstructures, i.e. Market/Sales, Product, Customer, Service, Resource and Engaged Party processes. \nThe Process Model discussed in this paper complements eTOM by providing an end-to-end \nprocess flow driven view to the different functional groupings. \nNote that this can be considered as a customized extension to the standardized Business Process \nFramework structure, which may be useful for some areas of application. This does not preclude \nother such extensions and customized views, where these are found useful, too. In particular, note \nthat the structure shown in Figure 1 and subsequent figures is not a \u201cdifferent\u201d process model, \n\n\nBusiness Process Framework, and no changes to the decomposition structure in the Business \nProcess Framework are being introduced here. Instead, the structure shown can be thought of as \na view of what happens inside a company\u2019s organization, when the process elements from the \nBusiness Process Framework are allocated to departments and business units. The view on the left \nin Figure 1, which is then shown also in Figure 2, can be considered as such an organizational view, \nand not in any sense in conflict with the decomposition hierarchy of the Business Process \nFramework, since this organizational view makes direct use of the process elements from the \nBusiness Process Framework. The concepts here are discussed at some length in Addendum G \n\u201cGuide to Applying the Business Process Framework\u201d, and the approach above is in line with this. \nWithin the TM Forum Business Process Framework, eTOM Level 1\u20133 already exists as a standard. \nHowever, the implementation of this standard can be facilitated through further enhancement in \nterms of process flows at Level 3 as demonstrated in Figure 1. Therefore, this document gives \nclear guidance on how to develop the identified core Customer Centric, Network and Product \nprocess flows, which are designed to be compliant with eTOM Level 1\u20133. \n \n \n\n\n1. End-to-End Business Streams \nGenerally, a service provider can be structured into core business processes, as well as control and \nsupport processes. One perspective that can be useful for the core business processes is to view \nthese as consisting of the Customer Centric processes and three additional process areas: \nCustomer, Product and Network. These can be seen to represent process domains arranged as \nend-to-end business streams which show a focus across the Service Provider for the area of \nbusiness activity concerned. Note that the use of the terms \u201cprocess domains\u201d and \u201cend-to-end \nbusiness streams\u201d here is just intended to explain this broad business context and is not a new \nelement of structure or terminology within the core Business Process Framework. \nIn this model, the Customer Centric processes are characterized as being initiated by the customer \nand ending at the customer. Additionally, the processes involved include all other core processes, \nwhich are not directly initiated by a customer (e.g. marketing campaign, product lifecycle \nmanagement, network operations). \n \n \nFigure 2.  A process view focused on customer-centric processes \n \nThe Customer Centric processes have several interactions with the other three process \nareas/domains. For instance, they might be initiated by relevant activities in the sense of CRM at \nthe Customer domain, and interactions may include trouble solving in the Network domain and \nthe Product domain. \n \n \nFig re 3 Process domain ie\ne ample\n\n\n1.1. Customer Centric End to End Business Streams \nA total of seven Customer Centric Processes represent the customer view and interaction with the \ntelecommunication company. These processes start with the customer initiating the contact. They \nend with the fulfilment of his/her request. Customer Centric processes include activities such as \nhandling information requests, new sale, billing and invoice generation or problem and complaint \nhandling. \n \n \nFigure 4.  Customer-Centric processes \n1.2. Network End-to-End Business Streams \nThis domain consists of six Network processes, which represent the network operations\u2019 view and \ninteraction within the telecommunications company. Network processes include activities such as \norder handling, trouble ticket management, billing, capacity management, and service lifecycle \nmanagement. \n \n \nFigure 5.  Network processes \n \n\n\n1.3. Product End to End Business Streams \nIn this domain there are six Product related core workflows for an operator and build the basis for \nthe generation of revenues. Product processes include activities such as product development, \nlaunch, retirement etc. \n \n \nFigure 6.  Product processes \n1.4. Engaged Party Flows \nIn this section we explore Engaged Party Domain of Business Process Framework and using \nengaged party processes in real world scenarios. This consists of worked examples of using eTOM \nprocesses for various most common processes of the organization. The framework discussed can \nbe used as best practice or guideline to arrive at a good understanding of using Engaged Party \nDomain."}

Engaged Party Flows \nThis section includes sample process-flows (eTOM level 3) relevant to the Engaged Party Flows. \nThe process-flows show how to apply the Engaged Party Domain, a part of eTOM to six phases of \nprocurement process. \nWe look at addressing the \u201cEffective management of procurement process using Business \nProcess Framework (eTOM)\u201d.There are various processes in industry to carry out procurement, \nbut doing it in a standard, well known, flexible approach will have a good value addition \nthroughout procurement lifecycle. \nHence, we choose to decompose and identify standard business process from Engaged Party of \nBusiness Process Framework which can be easily mapped to various phases of procurement \nprocess. We may not be able to get one-to-one mapping of procurement phase against eTOM \nprocesses, however we can identify the applicable group of processes. \n5.1. Process Flows for Procurement using Engaged Party \n5.1.1. \nOverview \n\u2022 \nProcurement process is a key activity for any organization which gets complex and challenging \nwith growing need for value addition. Likewise, there is always parallel need of standard, easy \nto adopt, industry-neutral process definition for procurement. The example defined in this \ndocument tries to address this and provide best practice that can be derived from business \nprocess framework. \n\u2022 \nThe idea behind this case study is to provide a road map and best practices organizations can \nuse during procurement process using standards defined in Frameworx. \n\u2022 \nAs mentioned, this section decomposes/ identifies process involved till Level 3 of business \nprocess framework that can be mapped to various phases of procurement process. \n  \n5.1.2. \nAssumptions \n\u2022 \nIn the scope of this example, process involving performance and problem reporting of external \nparties is not considered. This can be included as part of next versions of document. This case \nstudy was originally based on Frameworx 14.5 Model and was updated according to the latest \n16.0 Model. Engaged party domain is considered throughout the case study (since the Supply \npartner domain was replaced with Engaged party domain). This process can be fully \nautomated, but in some cases manual activities are also in scope. \n. \n5.1.3. \nPhases of procurement: \nBelow flow depicts procurement process at high level and the idea is to make this model as \ndomain/industry neutral as possible."}

Phases of Procurement Process \n \n\u2022 \nPhase 1: Define Scope of work/Definition of work: Define and review the definition of work, \nIntellectual property considerations, vendor selection method etc. \n\u2022 \nPhase 2: Verify Vendors and Issue RFP \u2013 Collect information about the vendors list and \nissue   RFP stating details. If required, conduct a session on RFP briefing. \n\u2022 \nPhase 3: Validate RFP response \u2013 verify RFP response from vendors including commercials, \nSOW and technical requirements and other criteria. \n\u2022 \nPhase 4: Purchase Agreement/ Formal award of contract \u2013 Publish contract award notice to \nselected vendor. Explain the terms and conditions of contract. \n\u2022 \nPhase 5: Contract Management \u2013 Set up a kick-off meeting, conduct regular follow up on \nprogress of work. \n\u2022 \nPhase 6: Post Contract \u2013 review the overall progress and milestones accordingly. \n5.1.4. \neTOM Mapping \nWe can now choose which processes from the Business Process Framework are needed, based on \nthe definition of the business problem set out originally, and based on the various phases of \nprocurement .We inspect the Business Process Framework and identify where the main focus of \nprocess activity is for the case concerned . \n \nProcurement \u2013 Phase 1 to 4: \nIn this section let us try to map eTOM processes to phase 1,2,3 and 4 of procurement process \ndefined in section 4.1.5. Phase 4 of procurement is spanned across two parts in this document for \nthe ease of understanding and continuity. \nIdentification of L1 process: \nAs we start with Mapping of business process framework with various phases of procurement, it \ncan be observed that L1\u2013 Engaged Party Domain is involved. We may not be able to identify one- \nto-one mapping of procurement phase against eTOM processes; however, we can identify the \napplicable group of processes. L1 process identified is common for all phases of procurement. \n  \n\n\n \nFigure 71.  Level 1 Process Framework mapping for procurement process \n \nWe observe that each of Level1 process identified can further be detailed to L2, L3 and L4 process \ndepending on complexity involved and granularity needed at various stages. Let us identify L2 \nprocess from identified L1 process. \n  \nIdentification of L2 process:  \n \nFigure 72.    Identification of Level 2 process in \u201cEngaged Party Domain (L1)\u201d \n \nNow we have a set of Level 2 process elements that we can use to address each phase of \nprocurement process. These processes can be mapped to phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 of procurement. \nLevel 2 processes identified are: \n1. Party Strategy and Planning, Party Tender Management, Party Engagement Development and \nRetirement, Party Agreement Management, Party Settlements & Payments Management from \nL1- Engaged Party Domain \n\n\nservice provider/vendor. \nNow, let us identify L3 process from identified L2 processes. \nIdentification of L3 process: \n \nFigure 73.  Identification of Level 3 process in \u201cParty Tender Management (L2)\u201d \n \n  \nFigure 74.  Identification of Level 3 process in \u201cParty Engagement Development and Retirement (L2)\u201d \n \n \nFigure 75.  Identification of Level 3 process in \u201cParty Agreement Management (L2)\u201d \n \nFigure above depicts the processes that can be mapped to L3 process under L2 process. This \nprocess defines policies, principles and performance standards of the organization which need to \nbe adhere by vendor/external service provider. \nExample: a process defining SLA for a software system. \n \nNow we have a set of Level 3 process elements that we can use to address each phase of \nprocurement process. These processes can be mapped to phase 1, 2, 3 and 4 of procurement. \nLevel 3 processes identified are  \n1. Determine Sourcing Requirements, Determine Potential Parties, Manage Tender Process from \nd\n\n\n3. Negotiate Commercial Arrangements, Gain Approval of Commercial Arrangements, and \nEstablish Party Agreement from L2 Party Agreement Management. \n \nProcurement \u2013 phase 4, 5 and 6: \nProcesses decomposed in this section are applicable to procurement phase 5 and 6 (defined in \nsection 4.1.5 of this document)  - awarding contract ,contract management and post contract \nphase. It is to be observed that phase 4 has spanned across two sections as process related to \nsupplier identification /award/maintaining spans across multiple processes. Now, let us identify \nLevel 2 process from identified L1 process. \nIdentification of L2 process: \n \nFigure 76.  Identification of Level 2 process in \u201cEngaged party domain (L1)\u201d \n \nNow we have a set of Level 2 process elements that we can use to address each phase of \nprocurement process. These processes can be mapped to phase 4, 5 and 6 of procurement. \nLevel 2 processes identified are: \n1. Party Engagement Development & Retirement, Party Support & Readiness, Party Agreement \nManagement, Party Settlements & Payments Management from L1- Engaged Party Domain. \n \nNow, let us identify Level 3 process from identified L2 process. \n \nIdentification of L3 process:  \n \n \nFigure 77.  Identification of Level 3 process in \u201cParty Engagement Development & Retirement (L2)\u201d \n \n\n\n \nFigure 78.  Identification of Level 3 process in \u201cParty Agreement Management (L2)\u201d \n \nNow we have a set of Level 3 process elements that we can use to address each phase of \nprocurement process further. These processes can be mapped to phase 4, 5 and 6 of \nprocurement. \nLevel 3 processes identified are   \n1. Manage Party Engagement and Terminate Party Engagement in L2 Party Engagement \nDevelopment & Retirement. \n2. Manage Party Agreement Violation and Terminate Party Agreement from L2 Party Agreement \nManagement. \n3. All of the processes in L2: Party Settlements & Payments Management   \n4. All of the processes in L2: Party Support and Readiness \n  \nWe observe that Manage Party Engagement process addresses various activities involved post\u2013\nawarding contract. Some of the activities can be arranging a kickoff meeting, monitoring and \ntracking the progress, escalations etc. We can also make use of any other process than ones \nidentified, depending on the nature of the deal/contract."}
