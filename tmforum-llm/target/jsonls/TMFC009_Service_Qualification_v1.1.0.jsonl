No resources are allocated \nduring Service Qualification. \nService Qualification component has functionality \nthat include checking service feasibility status \nand publishing or reporting service qualification \nresult, but also calculated service delivery due \ndate and identified need of an appointment at the \ncustomer site. \nService Qualification can also be in charge of the \ncost calculation of the technical solution \nidentified, when it cannot be determined at \ncatalog design time (complex B2B services).
