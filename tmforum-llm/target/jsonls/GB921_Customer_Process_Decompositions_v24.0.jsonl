This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process \ncomponents or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to\nshow organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. \nThe eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and\nthe starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional \napplication for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an \nindustry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with \nother enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required \nfunctions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. \n Introduction \nThis document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out \nthis domain. \nThe focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke\nProduct, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes. \nThe decomposition starts with a top level process which is a Core Process that details the activity that takes place and describes all subsequent activities \nthat occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then\n\n\np\ng\np\np\ng\np\np\nbelow them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition\ninclude another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   \nProcess Associations and IDs \nTo aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. \nProcesses have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: \n.b.x.c.d.e where  \n \nb: \nThis digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses \nto  \nextended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   \nx: \nDigit representing Domain  \nc: \nDigit representing Level 2 process \nd: \nDigit representing Level 4 process \ne: \nDigit representing Level 5 process \nThe unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. \n\n\nTypographic Conventions \n \n\u00b7  A Business Process is represented by a decorator in form of an arrow located to the top right. A red dot decorator with the initial TMF indicates that \nthis is a TM Forum Business Process. The color yellow background hints to the business  layer. \n \n \n \n\n\n Glossary \nName \nDescription \nABE \nAggregate Business Entity \nBE \nBusiness Entity \neTOM \nenhanced Telecom Operation Map (TMF Framework) \nODA \nOpen Digital Architecture \nSID \nShared Information Data model (TMF Framework) is the previous name of Information \nFramework \nTAM \nTelecom Applications Map (TMF Framework) is the previous name of Application \nFramework"}

Furthermore, CEM processes put customers at the center of marketing, \nsales and customer support in order to drive brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. \n \nExtended Description: \nCustomer Experience Management (CEM) is the collection of processes a company uses to track, oversee and organize every interaction between its \ncustomers and the organization throughout the customer lifecycle process. The purpose of CEM processes is to create and drive a customer-centric cultur\nto engender positive customer experience through journey design, experience perception, as well as tracking, overseeing and managing every interaction\u2014\nboth direct and indirect\u2014between the customer and the organization throughout the customer lifecycle. Furthermore, CEM processes put customers at the\ncenter of marketing, sales and customer support in order to drive brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. \nThe customer experience (CE) is comprised of a variety of elements, such as: cognitive, emotional, physical, sensorial, and social.  CE is based on two key\ncomponents. The first key component is the experience delivery in all direct interactions throughout the CSP's engagement and communication, products \nand/or services which apply in the above-described elements.  \nThe second key component is the measurement and management of the perception by the customer, including indirect interactions with the customer in \nwhich customer perception and knowledge play a strong role.  \nCEM processes guide voice of the customer (VoC) programs to quantify customer sentiment about their experiences with a company; they provide support\nfor the adjustment of elements of the customer experience that generate knowledge to improve CE. CEM processes promote and support a 360-degree \nview of customers, with integrated, up-to-date data on customer accounts. \nThe overall customer experience represents the full set of customer interactions across all customer journeys, it can be expressed as a set of qualitative \nand quantitative experience attributes. The set of attributes represents a calculated score on a scale from negative to positive Customer- Engagement-\nOver-Time. The measured customer experience reflects and results from the collection of experiences from every customer. \nCEM optimizes the experience of the interactions with the customer in all customer-journey-lifecycles and maximizes the delivered outcome in terms of \ncustomer value and business value. \n\n\n Analyze Customer Experience Journey Interactions \nProcess Identifier: 1.3.2.3 \nHierarchy Level: 3 \nBrief Description: \nThis process analyzes Customer Experience journey interactions in a predefined template, the purpose of such analysis is to identity gaps or possible \nimprovements with reference to the required customer experience objectives. \n \nExtended Description: \nThis process analyzes Customer Experience journey interactions in a predefined Business Offering CE journey template, the purpose of such analysis is to\nassess qualitative aspects of the customer experience for a specific Business Offering, and identity gaps or possible improvements with reference to the \nrequired customer experience objectives and relevant KPIs and metrics benchmarks. \n Design Customer Experience Journey \nProcess Identifier: 1.3.2.1 \nHierarchy Level: 3 \nBrief Description: \nThis process designs a Customer Experience journey for a specific Business Offering according to the desired outcome, the process defines the set of \ninteractions in the corresponding template for each customer journey.  \n \nExtended Description: \n\n\np\ng\np\nj\ny\np\ng\ng\ng\np\nBusiness Offering CE journey template.
