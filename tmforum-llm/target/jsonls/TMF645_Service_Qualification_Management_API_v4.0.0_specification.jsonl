It includes the \nmodel definition as well as all available operations.  \nIn the Open Digital Economy where multiple actors (SDPs, CSPs, \u2026) may be involved with the delivery of an end-to-\nend service, those actors need to collaborate and interact with the customer as needed. \nFollowing diagram shows ServiceQualification API within pre-ordering API package: \n \nService Qualification API is one of Pre-Ordering Management API Family. Service Qualification API goal is to provide \nservice technical eligibility in the context of the interaction. This API allows to: \n\u2022 \nRequest a specific service (of an array of service) eligibility providing as an input configured service. The \nresource checkServiceQualification is used for this purpose. The requester will provide an array of service \nqualification item and expect to have a qualification result for each one of them. In the response, the API \nwill provide qualification result but also: \n\u2022 \nEligibility unavailability reason (if any) \n\u2022 \nAlternate service proposal (if any). \n\u2022 \nLook for retrieving service available depending on criteria providing in the request \u2013 The main UC is to \nprovide a service category and a place for example and get in the response all available service. In the \nrequest the requested provided searchCiteria(s) \u2013 in response requester get this search criteria plus an \narray of serviceQualificationItem for each service available. Note that if no service are available, no error \nwill be triggered and no serviceQualificationItem will be in the answer (only searchCriteria are in the \nresponse) \nBecause the API allows describing service from the inventory, it is also possible to use it to retrieve service \navailable to complete existing service for both resources. \nThis API did not trigger any modification on the service in the inventory \u2013 in particular the service state is not \nchanged (no shift to eligibilityCheck) \n\n\nIn the request, for both resources, the following attributes could be filled: \n\u2022 \nservice, serviceSpecification, category or service characteristics will be indicated (at least one is \nmandatory), \n\u2022 \nrelatedParty, for which the qualification must be done, \n\u2022 \nplace, where the customer wants his service, \n\u2022 \nexpected qualification date. \nLifecycle \nThe state machine specifying the typical state change transitions is provided below. This is standard task based \nresource lifecycle: \n \n\n\nSAMPLE USE CASES \nTo provide some use-cases: \nFor checkServiceQualification: \n\u2022 \nCheck if we can deliver a 4k TV service at a specified address \n\u2022 \nCheck if we can deliver new IP TV service at the same location of an existing and active Access service  (i.e. \nwithout explicitly specifying address but using service relationship) \n\u2022 \nCheck if we can upgrade the download speed of an existing and active service from 100 Mb/s to 600Mb/s \n \nFor queryServiceQualification: \n\u2022 \nRetrieve a list of service specification \u2013 from a service category - available at a given place \n\u2022 \nRetrieve a list of service specification connecteable to an existing service \n\n\nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base \nentities, for instance a ServiceEligibility and TechnicalEligibility inheriting properties from the abstract \nCheckServiceQualification entity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nCheckServiceQualification instances some may be instances of ServiceEligibility where other could be instances of \nTechnicalEligibility. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type \nattributes that can be provided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a CheckServiceQualificationRef object) \nto explicitly denote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when \nused, denotes the class type of the reference itself, such as ServiceEligibilityRef or TechnicalEligibilityRef, and not \nthe class type of the referred object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally \nnot useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n \n\n\nRESOURCE MODEL \nManaged Entity and Task Resource Models \nCheck Service Qualification resource \nCheckServiceQualification is used to perform a technical eligibility on service configuration(s). It allows to retrieve \nservices that are technically available in the context of the interaction (place, party, service characteristics, ...). \nResource model \n \nField descriptions \nCheckServiceQualification fields \ndescription \nA string. Description of the serviceQualification. \neffectiveQualificationDate \nA date time (DateTime). Effective date to serviceQualification completion. \nestimatedResponseDate \nA date time (DateTime). Date when the requester expect to provide an answer for \nthe qualification request. \nexpectedQualificationDate \nA date time (DateTime). A date (DateTime).
