We \ncannot think of any scenarios where POOM would need to PATCH a service or \nresource order. PATCH is certainly applicable to other use cases (e.g., to allow \na user with appropriate privileges to add a note). However, order updates due \nto change in intent should be done through amendments, preferably using a \ntask-based mechanism similar to cancellation requests. For example, an \namendment of a product order would result in a new orchestration plan and \nchanges would trickle down to POOM, SOM and ROM as amendment and/or \ncancellation requests. See also On Revisions. We need Amend task operations \nfor all P/S/R order APIs. \n5.2.5. \nFurther resources \nThis component is involved in the following use cases described in IG1228 How to use \nODA - Using Open APIs to realize Use Cases: \n \n \n \n\n\n6.
