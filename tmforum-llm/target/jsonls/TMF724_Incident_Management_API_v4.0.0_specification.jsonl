Page 5 of 45 \nIntroduction \n \nCurrently, alarm-centric maintenance is used to monitor and troubleshoot telecom networks. Alarms are centrally \nmonitored and trouble tickets are generated based on alarm information. However, this approach has several \ndrawbacks: \n1. A large number of alarms can trigger a large number of trouble tickets, leading to low processing efficiency \nand difficulty in accurately identifying fault causes. \n2. Significant effort is required to manage a high volume of alarms, handle intermittent and jitter alarms, and \nprevent alarm loss.  \nTo address these issues, we introduce the TM Forum Incident Management API. This document defines the REST \nAPI for Incident Management. The API allows incidents can be created and linked to source entities at the Resource \nlayer. There is a strong desire among service providers for an Incident Management interface that can be used for \nsimple incident reporting as well as more complex OSS-to-OSS scenarios. The Incident Management interface \nshould support both and should not add complexity when used for simple incident reporting. \nIncident Information \nAn incident is described in increasing detail by the attributes shown in the diagram below. Every incident must \ninclude an category which places the incident within a small set of broad categories. A rootCause is optional and is \npopulated when diagnostics has been performed (See DiagnoseIncident Task). More detailed information about the \nincident may be provided in detail.  resolutionSuggestions described the necessary repair advice to resolve a given \nincident. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2023.

Page 7 of 45 \nSAMPLE USE CASES \nThe Incident Management API provides the standardized client interface to Incident Management systems for \ncreating (reporting), diagnosing and resolving incidents among partners. The interface supports incident \nmanagement on both resources and services. The incident events and source objects are not restricted to any \nparticular technology or vendor, so the API can be used in a wide variety of incident management cases. \nIn real-life deployments, we see various levels of incident management API needs starting from simple \nsubscriptions on incident lifecycle events, up to ITIL-aligned lifecycle methods such as diagnosis requests and \nresolution requests. \nAPI Operation \nUse Case \nGET on Incident \nRetrieve a list of all incidents \nGET/{id} on Incident \nRetrieve a specific incident by its ID \nPOST on Incident \nCreate a new incident \nGET on DiagnoseIncident \nRetrieve a list of all diagnosed incidents \nGET/{id} on DiagnoseIncident \nRetrieve a specific diagnosed incident by its ID \nPOST on DiagnoseIncident \nCreate a new diagnosis for an incident \nGET on ResolveIncident \nRetrieve a list of all resolved incidents \nGET/{id} on ResolveIncident \nRetrieve a specific resolved incident by its ID \nPOST on ResolveIncident \nCreate a new resolution for an incident \n \n \n \n \nFigure 0-1A API Operations Exposed \n \nScope of API \nNote the Remove and Modify Operations on Incident are not supported in this API. This is because the \nlifecycle of these aspects is controlled by the source management system and is not expected to be \ncontrolled outside of the domain manager. Also, the Create Incident (POST) operation is only included so \nthat TMF CTK operations can be included. \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2023.

Page 9 of 45 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base \nentities, for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account \nentity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF630 REST API Design Guidelines  \nPart 2 document. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nAccount instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. \nThe @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly \ndenote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes \nthe class type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of \nthe referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in \nreference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2023.

Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not \nsupport multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created \nagain. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null}"}
