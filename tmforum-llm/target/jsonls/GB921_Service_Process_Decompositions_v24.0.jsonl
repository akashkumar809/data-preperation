This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process \ncomponents or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to\nshow organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. \nThe eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and\nthe starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional \napplication for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an \nindustry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with \nother enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required \nfunctions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. \n \n Introduction \nThis document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out \nthis domain. \nThe focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke\nProduct, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes. \n\n\nThe decomposition starts with a top level process which is a Core Process that details the activity that takes place and describes all subsequent activities \nthat occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then\ndescribing a unique path of action and further detail the specific process. This is then repeated to lower level of granularly of up to seven levees.  \nAt the start of each Level 2 process a diagram details all of its sub processes is placed. This diagram showers Level 3 process and the level 4 process \nbelow them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition\ninclude another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   \nProcess Associations and IDs \nTo aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. \nProcesses have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: \n.b.x.c.d.e where  \n \nb: \nThis digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses \nto  \nextended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   \nx: \nDigit representing Domain  \nc: \nDigit representing Level 2 process \nd: \nDigit representing Level 4 process \ne: \nDigit representing Level 5 process \nThe unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. \n\n\nTypographic Conventions \n \n\u00b7  A Business Process is represented by a decorator in form of an arrow located to the top right. A red dot decorator with the initial TMF indicates that \nthis is a TM Forum Business Process. The color yellow background hints to the business  layer. \n \n \n \n\n\n Glossary \nName \nDescription \nABE \nAggregate Business Entity \nBE \nBusiness Entity \neTOM \nenhanced Telecom Operation Map (TMF Framework) \nODA \nOpen Digital Architecture \nSID \nShared Information Data model (TMF Framework) is the previous name of Information \nFramework \nTAM \nTelecom Applications Map (TMF Framework) is the previous name of Application \nFramework \n \n \n\n\n Service Domain \n \nService Strategy Management \nProcess Identifier: 1.4.1 \nHierarchy Level: 2 \nBrief Description: \nEnable the development of a strategic view and a multi-year business plan for the enterprise\u2019s services and service directions, and the parties who will \nsupply the required services. \n \n \n \nService Domain Main Diagram \n1.4.17- Service Anomaly\nLifecycle Management\ntmf\n1.4.18- Service Anomaly\nManagement\ntmf\n1.4.2- Service Capability\nDelivery\ntmf\n1.4.12- Service Capacity\nManagement\ntmf\n1.4.15- Service Catalog\nContent Management\ntmf\n1.4.13- Service Catalog\nLifecycle Management\ntmf\n1.4.14- Service Catalog\nOperational Readiness\nManagement\ntmf\n1.4.16- Service Catalog\nPlanning Management\ntmf\n1.4.5- Service Activation\nManagement\ntmf\n1.4.8- Service Guiding &\nMediation\ntmf\n1.4.6- Service Problem\nManagement\ntmf\n1.4.3- Service Specification\nLifecycle Management\ntmf\n1.4.19- Service Specification\nManagement\ntmf\n1.4.1- Service Strategy\nManagement\ntmf\n1.4.4- Service Support\nManagement\ntmf\nNot Fully Developed\nTMF status\n1.4.7- Service Performance\nManagement\ntmf"}

Research & analysis is performed to determine service targets as well as strategie\nto reach the defined targets. This research may be obtained from the external market, or developed internally through research programs and activities, or \nleverage of other internal knowledge. A key input to the service strategy arises from the enterprise\u2019s market and product portfolio strategy and forecasts. A \nfocus is placed on the expansion of the existing service capabilities and the identification of new service capabilities required. \nThese processes deliver and develop annual and multi-year service plans in support of products and offers that include volume forecasts, negotiation for \nrequired levels of resources, gaining service development and management as well as supply chain commitment and executive approval for the plans. \nForecasting of service demand, and capturing of new opportunities, are both essential to ensure that the enterprise can implement the services necessary \nfor the future needs of their customers and potential customers. \nThese processes define the service standards sought, key new service capabilities required, service support levels and approaches required, service \ndesign elements to be developed, as well as service cost parameters and targets.
