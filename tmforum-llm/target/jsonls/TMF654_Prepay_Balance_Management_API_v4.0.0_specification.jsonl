It includes the model \ndefinition as well as all available operations for the Prepay Balance Management API.  \nPrepay users pay up front before using services. Therefore, the users must have sufficient balance to use these \nservices. The purpose of this API is to manage and track these balances.  \nA bucket represents an entity that keeps track of the balance available to use services. Every bucket will measure \nbalance in different units, it can be monetary or non-monetary (for example a number of SMS that are available or \nthe number of GB of data that are available). Users can pass credit between different balance buckets, therefore \ntransferring balance from one bucket to another. Operators can provide multiple recharge channels to top up these \nbuckets to increase the balance to use for services. \nWhen a customer acquires a product offered by a service provider, the fulfilment process creates a set of bucket \nentities to track the balance for the services that comprise the product. As a part of the instantiation of a mobile line \nproduct, the fulfilment process creates voice, data and SMS buckets that are associated to the product and \nprovisioned to the Home Location Register. The process creates a prepaid account in the Prepay Billing System and \nan entry in the Customer Relationship Management databases. \nEach bucket has its own unique id assigned to it during the fulfilment process. This id uniquely identifies the bucket \nwhen topping up the balance on the bucket or any other of the actions that a consumer or agent performs on a \nbucket. Additionally, the consumer or agent can use a combination of the associated account and usage type to \nidentify the bucket. Usage type can be either of type monetary or non-monetary. \nEach bucket can have an association with more than one product. This enables consumers to share services for \nexample data bundles.  \nThe following is the list of resources that are associated with this API \n \n- Bucket: An entity that manages an amount of money or data associated with a product. The usage type of the \nBucket indicates whether the Bucket is responsible for managing a monetary amount or a non-monetary amount. \nTypical values for usageType would be monetary or data or text or voice. \n \n- TopupBalance: A task that operates on a Bucket resource. The TopupBalance task charges or recharges a Bucket \nwith an amount. The amount can be charged/recharged one time or recurringly. The TopupBalance resource is of \n@type TopupBalance and extends the Action resource. \n \n- AdjustBalance: A task that operates on Bucket resource. The AdjustBalance task  increments or decrements the \namount on a Bucket. The AdjustBalance resource is of @type AdjustBalance and extends the Action resource. \n \n- TransferBalance: A task that operates on Bucket resource. The TransferBalance transfers amounts from a source \nBucket to a target Bucket. The usage type of the source Bucket must match the usage type of the target Bucket. The \nTransferBalance resource is of @type TransferBalance and extends the Action resource. \n \n- ReserveBalance: A task that operates on Bucket resource. The ReserveBalance reserves an amount on a Bucket. \nThe ReserveBalance resource is of @type ReserveBalance and extends the Action resource. \n \n- BalanceAction: A resource that allows a consumer to retrieve a history of the tasks listed above that act on a \nBucket. The @type attribute specifies the type of the task.  \n \n- AccumulatedBalance: A resource that allows a consumer to retrieve an aggregation of amounts for many \nBuckets.   \n \n \n\n\n \nThe Prepay Balance API exposes the following operations on the following resources \n \n- Bucket:  \n \n           /GET  /bucket/{id} \n           Retrieve a Bucket resource using its unique identifier \n            \n           /GET /bucket \n           Retrieve a list of Bucket resources. \n \n- TopupBalance:  \n \n           /POST  /topupBalance \n           charges or recharges a Bucket with an amount.  \n            \n           /PATCH /topupBalance \n           cancels a topup operation. \n            \n           /GET /topupBalance/{id} \n           retrieves a TopupBalance resource using its unique identifier \n \n           /GET /topupBalance \n           retrieves a list of TopupBalance resources \n \n           /DELETE /topupBalance/{id} \n           deletes a TopupBalance resource \n \n \n- AdjustBalance:  \n \n           /POST  /adjustBalance \n           increments or decrements  a Bucket with an amount.  \n            \n           /PATCH /adjustBalance \n           cancels an adjustBalance operation. \n            \n           /GET /adjustBalance/{id} \n           retrieves an adjustBalance resource using its unique identifier \n \n           /GET /adjustBalance \n           retrieves a list of adjustBalance resources \n \n           /DELETE /adjustBalance/{id} \n           deletes an adjustBalance resource \n \n- TransferBalance:  \n \n           /POST  /transferBalance \n           transfers an amount from a source Bucket to a target Bucket. The usageType of each Bucket must match.  \n            \n           /PATCH /transferBalance \n           cancels a transferBalance operation. \n            \n           /GET /transferBalance/{id} \n           retrieves a transferBalance resource using its unique identifier \n \n           /GET /transferBalance \n\n\n           retrieves a list of transferBalance resources \n \n           /DELETE /transfertBalance/{id} \n           deletes a transferBalance resource \n \n \n- ReserveBalance:  \n \n           /POST  /reserveBalance \n           reserves an amount on a Bucket. \n            \n           /PATCH /reserveBalance \n           cancels a reserved amount on a Bucket. \n            \n           /GET /reserveBalance/{id} \n           retrieves a reserveBalance resource using its unique identifier \n \n           /GET /reserveBalance \n           retrieves a list of reserveBalance resources \n \n           /DELETE /reservetBalance/{id} \n           deletes a reserveBalance resource \n \n \n- BalanceAction:  \n \n           /GET  /balanceActionHistory \n           Retrieves a list of BalanceActions. BalanceActions are the following tasks:  \n \n           TopupBalance,AdjustBalance,TransferBalance and ReserveBalance \n \n- AccumulatedBalance:  \n \n           /GET  /accumulatedBalance \n           Retrieve a list of aggregated Bucket resources."}

Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, \nfor instance a TypeAServiceOrder or TypeBServiceOrder inheriting properties from the base ServiceOrder entity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nServiceOrder instances some may be instances of TypeAServiceOrder where other could be instances of \nTypeBServiceOrder . The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type \nattributes that can be provided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a RelatedParty object) to explicitly denote \nthe actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class \ntype of the reference itself, such as RelatedParty, and not the class type of the referred object. However, since \nreference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended \n \n \n \n\n\nRESOURCE MODEL \nManaged Entity and Task Resource Models \nBucket resource \nA bucket (called UsageVolumProduct in the SID Model) represents and tracks a quantity of usage (remaining or \nconsumed).

Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not support \nmultiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created again. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n\n\n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null} \n \n \n \n \n\n\nUnregister listener \n  DELETE /hub/{id} \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. \n \nRequest \n \nDELETE /api/hub/42 \nAccept: application/json \n \n \nResponse \n \n204 \n \nPublish Event to listener \n  POST /client/listener \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nProvides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the callback url \npassed when registering the listener. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example \u201cEVENT TYPE\u201d should be replaced by \none of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY \nrefers to the data structure of the given notification type. \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /client/listener \nAccept: application/json \n\n\n \n{ \n    \"event\": {  \n                EVENT BODY  \n            }, \n    \"eventType\": \"EVENT_TYPE\" \n} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \n \nFor detailed examples on the general TM Forum notification mechanism, see the TMF REST Design Guidelines. \n \n\n\nAppendix \n \n \nUsage Type \nValid units in \nQuantity \nDescription  \nmonetary \nEUR, GBP \netc. \nAny valid currency \ndata \nGB  \nGB indicates gigabyte \npromotional-\ndata \nMB \nMB indicates megabyte \nvoice \nminutes \nminutes indicates the amount is the \nnumber of minutes available to be \nconsumed \npromotional-\nvoice \nseconds \nseconds indicates the amount is the \nnumber of seconds available to be \nconsumed \ntext \nnumber \nNumber indicates the amount is the \nnumber of texts available to be \nconsumed \n\n\nAcknowledgements \nVersion History \n \nVersion \nNumber \nDate Modified \nModified by: \nDescription of changes \n4.0.0 \n29-Jul-2020 \nAlan Pope \nFinal edits prior to publication \n \nRelease History \n \nRelease Status \nDate  \nRelease led by: \nDescription  \nPre-production \n29-Jul-2020 \nKevin King - Vodafone \nUpdated based on schema-library \nand Design Guideline v4 patterns \nProduction \n23-Sep-2020 \nAdrienne Walcott \nUpdated to reflect TM Forum \nApproved Status"}
