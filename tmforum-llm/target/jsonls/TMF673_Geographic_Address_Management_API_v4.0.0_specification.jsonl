A geographic \naddress is a specialization of the abstract Place entity (like Geographic Site and Geographic Location).  \n \nThe following document is the specification of the REST API for geographic address management. It includes the \nmodel definition as well as all available operations. \nThe Geographic Address Management API provides a standardized client interface to an Address management \nsystem. \nIt allows looking for worldwide addresses. \nIt can also be used to validate geographic address data, to be sure that it corresponds to a real geographic address. \nFinally, it can be used to look for a geographic address by: searching an area as a start (city, town \u2026), then zooming \non the streets of this area, and finally listing all the street segments (numbers) in a street. \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Page 8 of 39 \nSAMPLE USE CASES \nThis section includes a set of main use cases that can be performed with this API. Additional use cases can be \ngenerated using the operations and resources defined in this specification. \n\u2022 Validate an address input by customer as part of order capture process  \n\u2022 Get the location (GeographicalLocation) of a given address  \n\u2022 Get geographic objects (Area, Street, StreetSegment) associated to an address \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved.                                                                                                                                Page 9 of 39 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, \nfor instance a Warehouse and Customer Access inheriting properties from the Geographic Site entity itself inheriting \nfrom geographic place. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nGeographic Site (or Geographic place) instances some may be instances of Warehouse where other could be \ninstances of Customer Access. The @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a \n@type attributes that can be provided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance in PlaceRef object) to explicitly denote \nthe actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class \ntype of the reference itself, such as WarehouseRef or CustomerAccessRef, and not the class type of the referred \nobject. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \nSome APIs, like Product Ordering, support providing a GeographicAddress as a polymorphic version of Place, per \nreference or per value. However, in the case there is a need to provide a specific GeographicSubAddress this \ncannot be done solely per reference, because the href mechanism doesn\u2019t allow this. In that case the \nGeographicAddress itself can be provided per reference, but the GeographicSubAddress (at least its id) has to be \nprovided per value: \n\u2026 \n\u201cplace\u201d: \n{ \n    \"id\": \"7513180\", \n    \u201cgeographicSubAddress\u201d: \n     { \n          \u201cid\u201d: \u201c3\u201d \n     }, \n   \u201c@type\u201d: \u201cGeographicAddress\u201d \n} \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not \nsupport multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created \nagain. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null} \n \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.
