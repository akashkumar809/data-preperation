Overview \nComponent \nName \nID \nDescription \nODA Function \nBlock \nProduct \nConfigurator \nTMFC027 The Product Configurator aims to provide \nsales representatives and customers with \nfast and error-free product qualification and \nproduct configuration capabilities across all \nchannels. \nIt uses mostly the Product Catalog and the \nProduct Inventory information, and is able \nto execute and check all types of Product \nCatalog policy rules (e.g. packaging rules, \ncommercial pre-requisite rules, pricing \nrules, consistency rules between \ncharacteristic values). It can also use Party \nrelated information, such as the age of the \ncustomer, or specific contextual \ninformation, such as the channel. \nIt can be triggered in contexts such as \nproduct order capture, shopping cart or \nquote management. It supports the Product \nOrder Capture and Validation component \n(TMFC002) to: \n\u2022 \nEstablish commercial offering \neligibility, and to provide alternative \nproduct offerings in case of \nineligible product offering selection \n\u2022 \nLeads the configuration of selected \neligible product offerings according \nto the context.
