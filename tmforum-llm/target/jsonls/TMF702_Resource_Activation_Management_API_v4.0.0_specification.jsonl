consistent/standardized mechanism to activate Resources. \nIt includes the model definition as well as all available operations. \n \nThe Resource Activation model definition is based on the same Resource model as in the Resource Inventory. \n\n\nSAMPLE USE CASES \nResource Activation queries (Use Case 1) \n  \nThe Resource Activation API can be used to query the resource instances to aquire resource activation states and \nthe attributes. \n \nResource Activation create/update  (Use Case 2) \n \nThe Resource Activation API can be used to create/update to configure and activate the resource instances."}

Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base \nentities, for instance a LogicalResource and PhysicalResource inheriting properties from the abstract Resource \nentity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nResource instances some may be instances of LogicalResource where other could be instances of PhysicalResource. \nThe @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a ResourceRef object) to explicitly \ndenote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes \nthe class type of the reference itself, such as LogicalResourceRef or PhysicalResourceRef, and not the class type of \nthe referred object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in \nreference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n \n\n\nRESOURCE MODEL \nManaged Entity and Task Resource Models \nResource resource \nResource is an abstract entity that describes the common set of attributes shared by all concrete resources (e.g. \nTPE, EQUIPMENT) in the inventory. \nResource model \n \nField descriptions \nResource fields \nactivationFeature \nA list of features (Feature [*]).
