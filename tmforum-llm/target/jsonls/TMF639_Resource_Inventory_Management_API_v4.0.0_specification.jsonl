The \nintent of this API is to provide a consistent/standardized mechanism to query and manipulate the resources of the \ninventory. \n \nIt includes the model definition as well as all available operations. \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Page 7 of 34 \nSAMPLE USE CASES \nResource inventory query for a party (Use Case 1) \n  \nThe Resource Inventory API can be used to query the resource instances for a party playing the role of customer via \nSelf Service Portal or the Call Centre operator can query the resource instances on behalf of the customer while a \ncustomer may have a complaint or a query.  \n \nResource inventory create/update as part of resource provisioning (Use Case 2) \n \nThe Resource Inventory API can be called by the Resource Order Management to create a new resource instance/ \nupdate an existing resource instance in the Resource Inventory."}

Page 8 of 34 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base \nentities, for instance a LogicalResource and PhysicalResource inheriting properties from the abstract Resource \nentity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nResource instances some may be instances of LogicalResource where other could be instances of PhysicalResource. \nThe @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a ResourceRef object) to explicitly \ndenote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes \nthe class type of the reference itself, such as LogicalResourceRef or PhysicalResourceRef, and not the class type of \nthe referred object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in \nreference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Page 31 of 34 \nAPI NOTIFICATIONS \nFor every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST \nnotification POST calls. \nIt is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST \nGuidelines reproduced below. \nRegister listener \n  POST /hub \nDescription \nSets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health \nstate, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not \nsupport multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created \nagain. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null}"}

The /client/listener url is the \ncallback url passed when registering the listener. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example \u201cEVENT TYPE\u201d should be replaced by \none of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY \nrefers to the data structure of the given notification type. \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.
