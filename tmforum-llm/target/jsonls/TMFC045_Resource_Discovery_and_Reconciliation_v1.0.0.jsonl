TM Forum Open APIs & Events \n \nThe following part covers the APIs and Events; This part is split in 3: \n\u2022 \nList of Exposed APIs - This is the list of APIs available from this component. At \nthis stage we list the APIs, resource and operation we no mention to optionally \n(in other word no mention about mandatory VS optional resource) \n\u2022 \nList of Dependent APIs - In order to satisfy the provided API, the  component \ncould require the usage of this set of required APIs. At this stage no optionally \nis defined and none of this 'required' API is listed as 'mandatory' \n\u2022 \nList of  Events (generated & consumed ) - The events which the component \nmay generate is listed in this section along with a list of the events which it may \nconsume. Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each \ndefined event. \n \n<Note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is \nrequired, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the \nnew Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In \naddition, a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the \nOpen API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of \nthe component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component \nspecification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. \nAlternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to \npublication.
