Page 11 of 161 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base \nentities, for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account \nentity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nAccount instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. \nThe @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly \ndenote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes \nthe class type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of \nthe referred object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in \nreference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended."}

Page 158 of 161 \nAPI NOTIFICATIONS \nFor every single of operation on the entities use the following templates and provide sample REST \nnotification POST calls. \nIt is assumed that the Pub/Sub uses the Register and UnRegister mechanisms described in the REST \nGuidelines reproduced below. \nRegister listener \n  POST /hub \nDescription \nSets the communication endpoint address the service instance must use to deliver information about its health \nstate, execution state, failures and metrics. Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not \nsupport multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created \nagain. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null} \n \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Page 159 of 161 \nUnregister listener \n  DELETE /hub/{id} \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. \n \nRequest \n \nDELETE /api/hub/42 \nAccept: application/json \n \n \nResponse \n \n204 \n \nPublish Event to listener \n  POST /client/listener \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nProvides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the \ncallback url passed when registering the listener. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example \u201cEVENT TYPE\u201d should be replaced by \none of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY \nrefers to the data structure of the given notification type. \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.
