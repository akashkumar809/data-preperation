SID ABEs \n<Note not to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new ABE is required, \nbut it does not yet exist in SID. Then you should include a textual description of the \nnew ABE, and it should be clearly noted that this ABE does not yet exist. In addition, a \nJira epic should be raised to request the new ABE is added to SID, and the SID team \nshould be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of the component \nwithout this ABE. If the ABE is critical then the component specification should not be \npublished until the ABE issue has been resolved. Alternatively, if the ABE is not critical, \nthen the specification could continue to publication.
