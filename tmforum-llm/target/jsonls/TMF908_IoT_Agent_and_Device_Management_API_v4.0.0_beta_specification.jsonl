Page 10 of 91 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, \nfor instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nAccount instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. \nThe @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly denote \nthe actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class \ntype of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred \nobject. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not \nsupport multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created \nagain. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if the request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null} \n \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

The /client/listener url is the callback \nurl passed when registering the listener. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example \u201cEVENT TYPE\u201d should be replaced by \none of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY \nrefers to the data structure of the given notification type. \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.
