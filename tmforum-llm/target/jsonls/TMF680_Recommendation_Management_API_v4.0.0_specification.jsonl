It includes the \nmodel definition as well as all available operations.  \nRecommendation API manages the following data resources:  \n- Recommendation is a type of automated (typically, conditional) system action to determine which products \nofferings to be presented as up-sells, cross-sells, and related products to each customer segment based on \ncustomer and session specific information. The design-time offers and product recommendations may come from \nMarketing and Catalog. The run-time evaluation and presentment will be executed with contextual/session \ninformation. Normally, it supports the recommendation of the offer which is proper for the customer, provides Up-\nsell and cross-sell based on contextual and catalog rules.  \n \n \nRecommendation API is used to recommend offering quickly based on the history and real-time context of \ncustomer. It is a real-time and personalized recommendation API. It is usually provided by e-commerce or BSS, CRM \nsystem in omni-channel.  \nThe typical example of recommendation is on the online e-commerce site. \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Page 7 of 38 \nSAMPLE USE CASES \nExample 1: a recommendation can be based on a party and a channel. In this case, the user is logged on the \nwebsite. A recommendation can be done, according to his actual product inventory. \n \n \nExample 2: a recommendation can be based on a shopping cart\u2019s content. In this case, the recommendation is \nbased on the contents of the shopping cart. \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Page 9 of 38 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base \nentities, for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account \nentity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nAccount instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. \nThe @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly \ndenote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes \nthe class type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of \nthe referred object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in \nreference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.
