It includes the model \ndefinition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are creating, updating and retrieving Resource Orders \n(including filtering). \nA Resource Order API provides a standard mechanism for placing a Resource Order with all necessary order \nparameters. A Resource Order is created based on a resource candidate that is defined in the resource catalog. The \nResource candidate is an entity that makes a Resource Specification available to a resource catalog. \nResources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an enterprise's \ninfrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by Services (for example a physical port assigned \nto a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the \nApplication, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, \ncontent and information, and technology components. \nA Resource Specification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a particular \ntype of Resource. In essence, a Resource Specification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set of \nrelated Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a particular Resource Specification. \nResource Order API manages resource order resource: \n- \nA Resource Order is a type of order which can be used to place an order between a service provider and a \npartner and vice versa \n- \nMain order items attributes are the orders resource candidates and resource characteristics with the \nrelated action to be performed (e.g: add or delete resources), state. \nResource Order API performs the following operations on the Resource Order: \n- \nRetrieval of a Resource Order or a collection of Resource Orders depending on filter criteria \n- \nPartial update of a ResourceOrder \n- \nCreation of a Resource order \n- \nDeletion of a resource order (for admin purposes) \n- \nNotifications of events on resource order \no Order creation \no Order removal \no Order state change \no Order value change \no Order information required \nThe following Assumptions were considered in the development of this document: \n- \nThe Order Management system has access to the catalog system \n\n\nSAMPLE USE CASES \nOrdering Optical Cable \n  \nThere is a use-case through the examples provided: \nThe operator is buying 7km of optical cable (the Physical Resource) made by FiberOpticsRUs (in the role of \nManufacturer) on behalf of Acme Inc (in the role of Customer). There is a note (of type Note) associated with this \norder, and a link to a previous Site Survey (Appointment). The order is known to Acme under its own internal ordering \nnumber (passed as an \u201cExternalReference\u201d). The Account manager (an Individual related party in the role of Account \nManager) is Gwen Howells. \nOnce created, later examples show: \n- \nRetrieval of orders under a Premium category \n- \nUpdate this order to change the priority to 2 \n- \nDelete this order using its id: 5130d5131a23 \n\n\nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, \nfor instance a LogicalResource and PhysicalResource inheriting properties from the abstract Resource entity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nResource instances some may be instances of LogicalResource where other could be instances of PhysicalResource. \nThe @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a ResourceRef object) to explicitly denote \nthe actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class \ntype of the reference itself, such as LogicalResourceRef or PhysicalResourceRef, and not the class type of the referred \nobject. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n\n\nRESOURCE MODEL \nLifecycle \nBelow is the state-transition diagram for a ResourceOrder: \n \nManaged Entity and Task Resource Models \nResource Order resource \nA Resource Order is a request to provision a set of Resources (logical and physical) triggered by the request to \nprovision a Service through a Service Order. \n \n \n\n\n \nResource model \n \nField descriptions \nResourceOrder fields \nhref \nAn uri (Uri). Hyperlink to access the order. \nid \nA string. Identifier of an instance of the Resource Order. Required to be unique \nwithin the resource type. \n@baseType \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class. \n@schemaLocation \nAn uri (Uri). A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional attributes and \nrelationships. \n@type \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the sub-class Extensible name. \ncancellationDate \nA date time (DateTime).

Type of the resource relationship, such as [bundled] if the resource is a \nbundle and you want to describe the bundled resources inside this bundle; [reliesOn] \nif the resource needs another already owned resource to rely on (eg: an option on an \nalready owned mobile access resource) [targets] or [isTargeted] (depending on the \nway of expressing the link) for any other kind of links that may be useful. \nresource \nA resource ref or value (ResourceRefOrValue). Resource is an abstract entity that \ndescribes the common set of attributes shared by all concrete resources. The \npolymorphic attributes @type, @schemaLocation & @referredType are related to the \nResource entity and not the related ResourceRefOrValue class itself. \nAppointmentRef relationship \nRefers an appointment, such as a Customer presentation or internal meeting or site visit. \nhref \nA string. The reference of the appointment. \nid \nA string. The identifier of the referred appointment. \n@baseType \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class. \n@schemaLocation \nAn uri (Uri). A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional attributes and \nrelationships. \n@type \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the sub-class Extensible name. \n\n\n@referredType \nA string. The actual type of the target instance when needed for disambiguation. \ndescription \nA string. An explanatory text regarding the appointment made with a party. \nConstraintRef relationship \nConstraint reference. The Constraint resource represents a policy/rule applied to an entity or entity spec. \n@referredType \nA string. The actual type of the target instance when needed for disambiguation. \nname \nA string. Name of the related entity. \nhref \nAn uri (Uri). Hyperlink reference. \nid \nA string. unique identifier. \n@baseType \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class. \n@schemaLocation \nAn uri (Uri). A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional attributes and \nrelationships. \n@type \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the sub-class Extensible name. \nversion \nA string. constraint version. \nResourceOrderItemRef relationship \n@baseType \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class. \n@schemaLocation \nAn uri (Uri). A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional attributes and \nrelationships. \n@type \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the sub-class Extensible name. \n@referredType \nA string. The actual type of the target instance when needed for disambiguation. \nitemId \nA string. Identifier of the line item. \nresourceOrderHref \nAn uri (Uri). Link to the order to which this item belongs to. \nresourceOrderId \nA string. Identifier of the resource order that this item belongs to. \nResourceSpecificationRef relationship \nResources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an enterprise's \ninfrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services (for example a physical port assigned \nto a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the \nApplication, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, \ncontent and information, and technology components. \n \n \n\n\nA ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a particular \ntype of Resource. In essence, a ResourceSpecification defines the common attributes and relationships of a set of \nrelated Resources, while Resource defines a specific instance that is based on a particular ResourceSpecification. \n@referredType \nA string. The actual type of the target instance when needed for disambiguation. \nname \nA string. Name of the related entity. \nhref \nAn uri (Uri). Hyperlink reference. \nid \nA string. unique identifier. \n@baseType \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class. \n@schemaLocation \nAn uri (Uri). A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional attributes and \nrelationships. \n@type \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the sub-class Extensible name. \nversion \nA string. Resource Specification version. \nJson representation sample \nWe provide below the json representation of an example of a 'ResourceOrder' resource object \n{ \n    \"id\": \"5130d5131a23\", \n    \"href\": \"http://host/resourceOrder/resourceOrder/5130d5131a23\", \n    \"category\": \"Premium\", \n    \"description\": \"7000m of Optical Cable\", \n    \"expectedCompletionDate\": \"2020-05-31T20:50:27.275Z\", \n    \"name\": \"7km Optical Cable for Acme Inc\", \n    \"orderDate\": \"2020-03-31T20:50:27.275Z\", \n    \"priority\": 0, \n    \"requestedCompletionDate\": \"2020-03-31T19:50:43.214Z\", \n    \"requestedStartDate\": \"2020-03-31T19:50:43.214Z\", \n    \"startDate\": \"2020-03-31T19:50:43.214Z\", \n    \"externalReference\": [ \n        { \n            \"externalReferenceType\": \"Acme Ordering Number\", \n            \"name\": \"8b032c8ca734\" \n        } \n    ], \n    \"note\": [ \n        { \n            \"id\": \"9ba1047c38ce\", \n            \"date\": \"2020-03-31T19:50:43.214Z\", \n            \"text\": \"Cable must be double jacketed as it may be exposed to water\" \n        } \n    ], \n    \"orderItem\": [ \n        { \n            \"id\": \"049eb3108ed5\", \n            \"quantity\": 7000,"}

Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not \nsupport multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created \nagain. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null} \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \nUnregister listener \n  DELETE /hub/{id} \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. \n \nRequest \n \nDELETE /api/hub/42 \nAccept: application/json \n \n \nResponse \n \n204 \n \nPublish Event to listener \n  POST /client/listener \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nProvides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the \ncallback url passed when registering the listener. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  \nUsage Samples"}
