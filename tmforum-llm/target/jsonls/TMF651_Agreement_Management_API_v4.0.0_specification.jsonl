In \nthe partnership AP, a Partnership Specifications typically declare Agreement Specifications, and Partnership \ninstances declare Party Roles instances that declare the Agreements that apply to them. \n\n\nSUPPORT OF POLYMORPHISM AND EXTENSION \nPATTERNS \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base \nentities, for instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account \nentity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nAccount instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. \nThe @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly \ndenote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes \nthe class type of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of \nthe referred object. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in \nreference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n \n\n\nRESOURCE MODEL \nMANAGED ENTITY AND TASK RESOURCE MODELS \nAgreement resource \nAn agreement represents a contract or arrangement, either written or verbal and sometimes enforceable by law, \nsuch as a service level agreement or a customer price agreement. An agreement involves a number of other \nbusiness entities, such as products, services, and resources and/or their specifications. \nResource model \n \nField descriptions \nAgreement fields \nagreementAuthorization A list of agreement authorizations (AgreementAuthorization [*]).

In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created \nagain. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null} \n \n \n \n\n\n \nUnregister listener \n  DELETE /hub/{id} \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. \n \nRequest \n \nDELETE /api/hub/42 \nAccept: application/json \n \n \nResponse \n \n204 \n \nPublish Event to listener \n  POST /client/listener \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nProvides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the \ncallback url passed when registering the listener. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  \nUsage Samples \n\n\nHere's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example \u201cEVENT TYPE\u201d should be replaced by \none of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY \nrefers to the data structure of the given notification type. \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /client/listener \nAccept: application/json \n \n{ \n    \"event\": {  \n                EVENT BODY  \n            }, \n    \"eventType\": \"EVENT_TYPE\" \n} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \n \nFor detailed examples on the general TM Forum notification mechanism, see the TMF REST Design \nGuidelines."}
