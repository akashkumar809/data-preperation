Page 5 of 58 \nIntroduction \n \nThe following document is the user guide of the REST API for Document and DocumentSpecification management. \nIt includes the model definition as well as all available operations. \n \nThe Document API manages the meta-data related to a Document, such as the related parties (like author, \nreviewer, publisher), the creation date, version, and lifecycle status. The body of the Document itself is either held \nor referred to by the associated Attachment. Binary content might be encoded into the Attachment.content \nattribute, or (if by reference) referred to by the Attachment.url attribute \u2013 such as a file: or https: reference. \nAttachment is not a managed resource since the binary content is assumed to be resident in a Content \nManagement System and not created by an API \u2013 only retrieved from or referred to. \nEach Document type (such as PDF file, Word document, Image or Video) might be described by its own \nDocumentSpecification. This resource manages the collection of characteristics that detail the contained media \ntype. For example, the DocumentSpecification for a \u201cbook\u201d might have characteristics such as number of pages \nlanguage, an ISBN, publisher and dimensions. \nThe DocumentSpecification follows the EntitySpecification pattern, so you can describe both the nature of the \ncharacteristics themselves (such as their name, cardinality, mandatory/optional) as well as the nature of the value \nof those characteristics (whether the value of that characteristic is an integer, string or boolean, say \u2013 or conform \nto a particular regular-expression or sit within a linear range). \nFor example: \n- \nA DocumentSpecification for \u201cvideo\u201d might have characteristics such as a \u201cplaylength\u201d in integer seconds, a \n\u201cwidth\u201d and \u201cheight\u201d in integer pixels, and \u201chasAudio\u201d as a boolean. \n- \nA Document \u2013 (managing the meta-data of the video) might add the video\u2019s author (as a role played by a \nRelatedParty), it\u2019s creation date, a lifecycle status to say that it is \u201cpublished\u201d, and reference the \u201cvideo\u201d \nDocumentSpecification for details of the further characteristics that can be discovered, relevant to this \nparticular Document type. \n- \nThe associated Attachment might represent a link to an online YouTube video in the \u201curl\u201d attribute. \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Page 7 of 58 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, \nfor instance a BillingAccount and SettlementAccount inheriting properties from the abstract Account entity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nAccount instances some may be instances of BillingAccount where other could be instances of SettlementAccount. \nThe @type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly denote \nthe actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class \ntype of the reference itself, such as BillingAccountRef or SettlementAccountRef, and not the class type of the referred \nobject. However since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been extended. \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

If by value - the binary content is held in the Attachment.content. \nIf by reference, the Attachment.url might point to a (file:) or remote (http:) pointer to the Document media. \n \nA Document may be associated with a DocumentSpecification, which will detail the characteristics of that type of \nDocument (an Image may have a width, height and format; a Video may have a length and format). \nA Document has a collection of RelatedParty's, for roles such as author, reviewer, publisher; and a lifecycle status \nto take the document through a simple set of production stages. \nResource model \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.

Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not \nsupport multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created \nagain. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null} \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2020.
