Since there is a possibility of multiple sources and receivers for each \ndefined event. \n<Note to be inserted into ODA Component specifications: If a new Open API is \nrequired, but it does not yet exist. Then you should include a textual description of the \nnew Open API, and it should be clearly noted that this Open API does not yet exist. In \naddition a Jira epic should be raised to request the new Open API is added, and the \nOpen API team should be consulted. Finally, a decision is required on the feasibility of \nthe component without this Open API. If the Open API is critical then the component \nspecification should not be published until the Open API issue has been resolved. \nAlternatively if the Open API is not critical, then the specification could continue to \npublication. The result of this decision should be clearly recorded.> \n3.1.
