These processes \nmay occur in real-time, near real-time (i.e. \njust at the end of the usage), or may be \nexecuted on a periodic basis. \nBased on Service Usage, this process aims \nat identifying Product Usage. For example, \nfor a Video on Demand where you can \nwatch a video as many time as you want \nduring 72 hours, several Service Usages \nmight have been tracked (each time the \nuser watches the video) and only one \nProduct Usage will be identified for all \nService Usages in the 72 hours after the \nfirst watch. \nThe guiding processes ensures that the \nProduct Usage records used in the billing \nprocesses are appropriately related to the \ncorrect customer billing account and \nproducts. \nThe Product Usage records are edited and \nif necessary reformatted (mediated) to \nmeet the needs of subsequent processes. \nThe billing event records may also be \nenriched with additional data during this \nprocess. \n1.2.16.1 \nL3 \nProduct Usages \nThe Enrich Product Usages processes will \naugment the product usage records by \nadding data to the records from sources \nsuch as customer, product,  or other \nreference data. \n1.2.16.1.1 L4 \nAdd Product Usage Data \nAdd data to the records from sources such \nas customer, product, or other reference \ndata to augment the product usage \nrecords. \n1.2.16.1.2 L4 \nAssign Product Usage \nPrice \nAssign a price to product usage without \nconsideration of specific product or \ncustomer information. The assigned price \n\n\nIdentifier \nLevel Business Activity Name \nDescription \nmay be used to enrich the product usage \nrecord. \n1.2.16.2 \nL3 \nGuide and Assign \nProduct Usages \nThe Guide Product Usages processes \nensure that the event records used in the \nbilling process relate to the correct \ncustomer billing account and products.  A \nspecific product usage record may be \nrelated to multiple customer billing \naccounts and subscribed products. \nDistribution of product usage records to \nother processes may also occur. \n1.2.16.2.1 L4 \nAssign Product Usages \nEnsure that the Product Usages used in \nthe billing process relate to the correct \nProduct. \n1.2.16.2.2 L4 \nDistribute Product Usage \nDistribute billing event records to other \nprocesses. \n1.2.16.2.3 L4 \nGuide Product Usages \nGuide Product Usages process is in charge \nof identifying Product Usages based on \nService Usages. \nFor example, for a Video on Demand \nwhere you can watch a video as many time \nas you want during 72 hours, several \nService Usages might have been tracked \n(each time the user watches the video) and \nonly one Product Usage will be identified \nfor all Service Usages in the 72 hours after \nthe first watch. \n1.2.16.3 \nL3 \nMediate Product Usages \nThe Mediate Product Usages process edits \nand reformats the data record to meet the \nneeds of a recipient application. \n1.2.16.3.1 L4 \nEdit Product Usages \nEdit the data record for recipient \napplications. \n1.2.16.3.2 L4 \nReformat Product \nUsages \nReformat the data record for recipient \napplications. \n1.2.16.4 \nL3 \nReport Product Usage \nRecords \nThe purpose of the Report Product Usage \nRecord processes is to generate reports on \nProduct Usage records based on requests \nfrom other processes. \nThese processes produce reports that may \nidentify abnormalities, which may be \ncaused by fraudulent activity or related to \ncustomer complaints. \nInvestigation of problems related to these \nproduct usage records is also part of this \nprocess. \nThese processes also support other \nprocesses such as customer review of \n\n\nIdentifier \nLevel Business Activity Name \nDescription \nproduct usages (pre-billing and post-\nbilling). \n1.2.16.4.1 L4 \nGenerate Product Usage \nReport \nGenerate reports on product usage records \nbased on requests from other processes. \n1.2.16.4.2 L4 \nInvestigate Product \nUsage Related Problem \nInvestigate problems related to product \nusage records. \n1.2.16.4.3 L4 \nSupport Product Usage \nRelated Process \nSupport other processes such as customer \nreview of product usages (pre-billing and \npost-billing). \n1.2.17 \nL2 \nProduct Rating & Rate \nAssignment \nThe purpose of Product Rating & \nAssignment is to rate a value (monetary or \nother) to Product Usage or a set of Product \nUsages and assign the result to a Product \nand a Billing Account. The charge may be \neither a credit or a debit and can be \nhandled either online or offline. \nOnline charging is performed in real-time, \nrequiring an authorization component \nwhich may affect how the service is \nrendered and enables an operator to \nprovide prepaid services to its customers. \nWhereas offline charging is performed after \nthe service is rendered and is not required \nto be done in real-time and generally \nrelates to subscription based products. \n1.2.17.1 \nL3 \nPerform Rating \nProcess responsible for calculating the \nvalue of a product usage or a set of product \nusages, before, during or after the \nrendering of the service, based on \nparameters of the request (type, quantity, \netc.), parameters of the \ncustomer/subscriber (tariffs, price plans, \naccumulated usage, contracts, etc.) and \nother parameters (time-of-day, taxes, etc.). \nThe same request maybe rated differently \nfor different subscribers based on their \npurchased offers or agreements. \n1.2.17.2 \nL3 \nAggregate Items For \nRate Assignment \nThis process is responsible for \naccumulating contributing items, which can \nbe quantities, values (monetary or other) or \nboth. Aggregation can occur over time or \ncan be initiated to gather a \u201csnapshot\u201d of \nthe items at a point in time. \n1.2.17.3 \nL3 \nManage Customer \nAssignment \nHierarchyManaging the \ncharging relationships \namong subscribers. \nCustomer hierarchies are commonly used \nfor corporate customers, family plans or \nother type of affinity groups. This process \nmanages the assignment relationships \namong subscribers, e.g. sharing, inheriting \nor restricting balances, price plans and"}

Thereby assuring that a charge \nis added to or subtracted from the correct \naccount balance. \n1.2.17.4 \nL3 \nProvide Advice of Rate \nThe activity of Provide Advice of Rate (aka \nAdvice of Charge) is responsible for \nproviding advice on rates, in real-time or \noffline, an estimate or value of the rate for a \nspecific usage request. The advice is \nusually based upon performing a full rating \nprocess for the request. \n1.2.17.5 \nL3 \nApply Rate Level \nDiscounts \nThis process applies discounts to product \nprices at an individual product level. A \ndiscount may be expressed as a monetary \namount or percentage, and modifies a price \nfor a product. When a discount is \nexpressed as a percentage, the \ndiscounting process determines the \ndiscount calculated in relation to the price \nfor the product. \nThe discount may be displayed as a \nseparate entry on the bill or may be \ncombined with the rate for the product to \nonly show as one entry. \nDiscounts may be a one-time event or may \nhave some duration (days, months, life of \nproduct, etc.).
