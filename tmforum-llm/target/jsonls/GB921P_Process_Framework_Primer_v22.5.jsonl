It assists new readers and \nusers of Business Process Framework by providing an introductory view of some of the concepts, goals, \nand structure of the Business Process Framework work. \nIt should be read in conjunction with the main GB921 document, and other Addenda (see GB921 Concepts \nand Principles for details). \n \n \n \n \n\n\n1. \nWhat is the Business Process Framework? \nThe Communications and Digital services industry is facing unprecedented churn and the struggle to \nremain profitable in the face of more competition, higher customer expectations, falling market share and \ngrowing price pressures. The industry has a need to clearly define and understand the business processes \ninvolved in order to tackle these issues. It also needs to reach a consensus on the common process view \nfor equipment suppliers, applications builders and integrators to build management systems by combining \nthird party and in-house developments. \nThe Business Process Framework (also known as the eTOM) is an ongoing TM Forum initiative to deliver a \nbusiness process model or framework for use by Communications and Digital services industry. The goal is \nto set a vision for the industry to enable it to compete successfully through the implementation of business \nprocess-driven approaches to managing the enterprise. This includes ensuring integration among all vital \nenterprise support systems concerned with service delivery and support. \nThe focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the \nlinkages between these processes, the identification of interfaces, and the use of customer, service, \nresource, supplier/partner and other information by multiple processes. The TM Forum Business Process \nFramework is a reference framework for categorizing all the business activities that a service provider will \nuse, in a structured manner that allows these to be addressed at various levels of detail. For such \ncompanies, it serves as the blueprint for process direction and provides a neutral reference point for \ninternal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with other \nproviders. For suppliers, the Business Process Framework outlines potential boundaries of software \ncomponents to align with the customers' needs and highlights the required functions, inputs, and outputs \nthat must be supported by products.  \nA particular strength of the Business Process Framework is that as a foundation  core element in the former \nFrameworx program , it provided a foundation along with other works underway in the Open Digital \nFramework (ODF) program, namely the evolution of the Information Framework, the Application \nFramework along with Open APIs, along with ODA and other TM Forum leading programs. \nSo, the Business Process Framework defines a business-oriented view of the enterprise. This view is useful \nfor planners, managers, strategists, etc., who need to view the enterprise in business terms, without \nimmediate concern for the nature of the way that these business needs are organized or automated within \nthe business. Therefore, the Business Process Framework emphasizes issues such as process structure, \nprocess components, process interactivity and the business roles and responsibilities to which these relate. \nIn defining these aspects, the Business Process Framework also provides a basis for setting requirements \nfor system solutions, technical architectures, technology choices and implementation paths, but it is \nneutral towards the particular way that these requirements are met. \nThus, the Business Process Framework can be considered to have two faces: one oriented towards the \nbusiness, customer, products, etc., and one towards solutions, systems and implementations supporting \nthe business. \n \n \n\n\n \nIt should be recognized that through the TM Forum work, the Business Process Framework represents an \nindustry-consensus on the Service Provider processes, which has been harmonized across the global scene \nand is based on Member contributions. It is allowable, and indeed expected, that this will mean that the \nBusiness Process Framework must be tailored and/or extended for use within an individual company. In \nparticular, the Business Process Framework does not seek to constrain the way that the processes fit into \na specific organization. An advantage of this positioning of the Business Process Framework as a \nframework, rather than a directly-implemented specification, is that differentiation amongst the Business \nProcess Framework users is not restricted, which is vital to allow specialization and competition. In addition, \nas already mentioned, the Business Process Framework does not fix upon particular routes to \nimplementation and is thus valid in many different environments with varying levels of automation, \ntechnology, etc. \nSo, the Business Process Framework is a framework, not a final implementation specification. It will \ntypically be customized and extended by users for their own business needs but provides a vital common \nreference that is industry recognized and represents de-facto, and now through ITU-T an official standard \nwithin and between companies on business process definition."}

Where did the Business Process Framework \ncome from? \nWork on business process modeling by the TM Forum (formerly the TeleManagement Forum and the \nNetwork Management Forum before then) began in the early 1990\u2019s with the Service Management \nAutomation and Reengineering Team (SMART) that gathered worldwide Service Provider views and \ndistilled an initial Business Process Model. This work grew in the Telecom Operations Map (TOM) \nduring the mid-90\u2019s leading to the stabilization and publication of TOM in its final form towards the \nend of that decade. \nThe TOM work gained wide industry support, but the scope of the TOM model did not cover the whole \nof the SP enterprise and only focused on the main Operations processes embodying the traditional \ntelecoms activities around Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing (FAB). Increasingly, the complexities of \ninterworking in the deregulated, competitive telecoms market required a complete enterprise view, \nand new business demands triggered by the internet and electronic commerce generally, led to a move \nto expand TOM to address this wider perspective. \nThus, eTOM \u2013 for enhanced TOM \u2013 was initiated as a work program led by TM Forum as we entered \nthe new Millennium. Initial releases of eTOM were provided to TM Forum members during 2001, and \nthen a TM Forum Approved version of eTOM \u2013 GB921 v3.0 \u2013 was released in mid-2002. This was \nwelcomed and adopted widely, and so further work to cement agreements, incorporate industry \nfeedback, and extend the level of detail described resulted in further intermediate versions and then \na new TM Forum Approved version early in 2004. This version \u2013 GB921 v4.0 \u2013 was also submitted under \na liaison agreement to the ITU-T, which acts as the premier world-wide body with a remit under the \nUnited Nations for setting international Recommendations in the telecommunications sphere. This \neTOM version was adopted by ITU-T in toto and has been published in parallel as their formal \nRecommendation M.3050, with exact alignment on the content with TM Forum\u2019s GB921 v4.0. \nIn 2009 due to the converging of the Information, Communications and Digital Media industries into \nwhat is now considered the Digital Services industry and the widening use of the eTOM, the TM Forum \ndecided to rebrand the eTOM to the Business Process Framework. It was felt this would remove any \nartificial concerns about using the eTOM in non-telecommunications environments and broaden the \nuptake and adoption of the Business Process Framework (eTOM). \nThroughout this history, the Business Process Framework work has benefited from wide involvement \nfrom the global telecommunications industry, as well as academia, government agencies, etc. As it has \nevolved, the core has shown it can stand the test of time, and it is now regarded as the pre-eminent \nvehicle for expressing and discussing business processes in and around the Service Provider domain. \nThe work continues, with an increasing emphasis now that the Business Process Framework has \nestablished a clear and agreed view of the business process framework itself, on applications of the \nBusiness Process Framework and guidance to prospective and existing users on how to gain maximum \nbenefit from the Business Process Framework in their own businesses. \n\n\n3. How does the Business Process Framework \nwork? \n3.1 Domain definition \nSince an earlier release of the Business Process Framework (Rel. 14.5), the collaboration team \ndecided to formalize and generalize the notion of domains, in place of the previously existing level 0 \nhorizontal process groupings. This allowed us to ensure consistency and sound alignment with the \nother components of the Frameworx brand (namely SID and TAM). The 7 domains that were \nrecognized (see figure below) were: \n1. Market & Sales domain \n2. Customer domain \n3. Product domain \n4. Service Domain \n5. Resource Domain \n6. Business Partner domain \n7. Enterprise domain \n3.2 Process Decompositions \nProcess decomposition is a structured approach to analysis of a business through consideration of \nthe enterprise\u2019s business processes and their internal structure. The basis of the concept is illustrated \nin Figure 1-1 below. Here we see a representative process element, Process X, which might provide \na specific area of capability within an enterprise \u2013 say, handling of customer orders, for example. \nWhen analyzed, it is decided that the contained functionality, behavior, etc. associated with that \nprocess can/should be sub-divided into three lower-level process elements. Note that typically such \na \u201cdecomposition\u201d is partly evident from the analysis of the detail captured within the process \nconcerned, and partly is the result of design decisions, where judgment is used to make the most \nappropriate partitioning for the situation under consideration."}

Note that not all \u201cbranches\u201d of the decomposition \u201ctree\u201d necessarily led to \u201cleaves\u201d (i.e., \nfinal process elements) at the same level of decomposition. This will depend on the scope and \ncontent of the processes involved. \nThe process decomposition approach has these general characteristics: \n\u2022 \nIt defines components of a process that perform part of that process \n\u2022 \nIt provides insight into the structure and content of process areas (or groupings) \n\u2022 \nIt reveals finer detail at lower levels, as decomposition proceeds \n\u2022 \nIt can be continued to as many sub-levels as are needed \n\u2022 \nThe aim is to provide a complete analysis of the process under decomposition - i.e., the \nsum of the components equals the totality of the original process \n\u2022 \nIt represents a static perspective of process \n\u2022 \nIt does not mandate any flow relationship between the process elements \nNote that the process elements derived through process decomposition may be applied in various \nways within process flows. There may be many process flows (representing, say, enterprise-specific \napplications) that can be built using the common set of process elements specified within the \nBusiness Process Framework. There is further discussion on process flows later in this section, \nincluding the process flow diagrams that arise and are used in this work. \nThe process decomposition for the Business Process Framework (see Figure 1-2) begins at the \nEnterprise level and defines business processes in a series of groupings. The Business Process \nFramework uses hierarchical decomposition to structure the business processes according to which \nall of the processes of the enterprise are successively decomposed. Process descriptions, inputs and \noutputs, as well as other key elements are defined. The Business Process Framework represents the \nwhole of a service provider\u2019s enterprise environment. The Framework is defined as generically as \npossible so that it is organization, technology, and service independent. At the overall conceptual \nlevel, the Business Process Framework can be viewed as having the following two major process \nareas: \n \n \nProcess X\n-\nProcess Element \nX1\n-\nProcess Element \nX3\n-\nProcess Element \nX2\n-\nProcess Element \nX21\n-\nProcess Element \nX22\n-\nProcess Element \nX211\n-\nProcess Element \nX212\n\n\n \nStrategy to Readiness covering planning, capability delivery and lifecycle management \nOperations covering the core of operational management \nFigure 1-2: Business Process Framework (eTOM) \n \nThe Business Process Framework (see Figure 1-2) shows seven context verticals. These verticals \nwere originally created to represent the various stages that participate in the life cycle of the \nenterprise from Strategy to Operations; they help classify and qualify processes when decomposing \nand structuring the Business Process Framework. They are part of the business process map as they \nrepresent a set of contextual boundaries for level 2 core processes. Amongst these context verticals \n(or vertical process groupings as they were previously known), the right side of the Framework \nrepresents the Operations process area, which is a collection of operations-centric processes \ncovering Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing & Revenue Management (aka FAB). \nOperations Readiness & Support (OR&S) is differentiated from FAB processes to highlight the focus \non enabling support and automation in FAB, i.e., on-line and immediate support of customers, with \nOR&S ensuring that the operational environment is in place to ensure the FAB processes are able \nto operate optimally. Outside of the Operations process area - in the Strategy to Readiness (S2R) \nprocess area - the Strategy Management vertical, as well as the Capability Delivery and Lifecycle \nManagement verticals, are differentiated. These are distinct because, unlike Operations, they do \nnot directly support the customer, and are intrinsically different from the Operations processes. \nWith the evolution of the business the sense of time has been compressed with increasing \nautomation, and what used to be short term processes are becoming increasingly closer to real \ntime. \n \n \n\n\nThe Framework also depicts cross-functional domains as they span horizontally across an \nenterprise\u2019s internal organization. The horizontal cross-functional process groupings (referred to as \ndomains) in Figure 1-2 distinguish strategy-centric, development-centric processes from \noperations-centric processes, e.g., Marketing versus Selling, Customer Strategy versus Customer \nSupport, Service Development versus Service Configuration, etc. Amongst these horizontal \ndomains, those on the left (that cross the Strategy Management, Capability Delivery and Lifecycle \nManagement verticals provide the strategy, implement the infrastructure, and define the work in \nthe Operations process area. \nThe Business Process Framework Model graphically illustrates the business processes required for \noperating service provider enterprises. It lays out these processes first from a high-level \nperspective, and then drills down to increasingly detailed levels of understanding. The Business \nProcess Framework describes in text what the model describes graphically. \n \n \nFigure 1-3 : The Business Process Framework Operations (OPS) Processes"}
{"tmforumApiId": "GB921P", "id": "GB921P-chunk-5", "chunkIndex": 5, "totalChunks": 8, "apiName": "Process Framework Primer v22.5", "title": "GB921P_Process_Framework_Primer_v22.5 (Part 5/8)", "documentType": "Tmforum api user guide", "text": "The Business Process Framework is structured in two main process areas: Operations (OPS) and \nStrategy to Readiness (S2R). Each process area consists of more detailed process components and \ndecomposition at levels 1, 2, 3, etc. This hierarchical decomposition enables detail to be defined in a \nstructured way and also allows the Business Process Framework to be adopted at varying levels \nand/or for different processes. Each process element has a process ID which indicates the process \nlevel and degree of detail revealed at that level - the more digits in the process ID, the more granular \ndetail in the process is available. \nOperations (OPS - see Figure 1-3) is the heart of the Business Process Framework and much of the \noriginal TOM work has carried through into OPS (the GB921 documentation provides some insight \ninto the relationship between the TOM and the eTOM). The \u201cFAB\u201d processes (Fulfillment, Assurance, \nBilling & Revenue Management) provide the core of the Operations area, the horizontal domains \n(Level 1) namely Market & Sales, Customer, Product, Service, Resource, Business Partner and \nEnterprise) provide the context for the definition of activity flows. \nOR&S (Operations Readiness & Support) has been separated from FAB originally to reflect the \nseparation between \u201cfront-office\u201d, \u201cCustomer-supporting\u201d real-time operations (in FAB) from \u201cback-\noffice\u201d near real-time support processes. This split may not apply in some organizations (in which \ncase, the OR&S and FAB processes may be merged) but it is necessary to keep the separation to \ndistinguish their purpose and lifecycle footprint. \n \n\n\n \nIn Figure 1-4, the OPS area is shown with Level 2 (core) processes visible. Note that a Level 2 process \nis part of a horizontal domain and typically positioned within one vertical, however, in some cases, a \nLevel 2 process can span across several context verticals (e.g., Resource Data Collection and \nDistribution). This is because such process belongs to more than one vertical context (e.g., for \nResource Data Collection & Distribution), the data collected from the network elements may \nrepresent usage data for Billing & Revenue Management but may also support fault handling or \nperformance assessment in Assurance). \n \nFigure 1-5 :  An example of Level 3 Operations (OPS) Processes \n \nThis mechanism of decomposition can be extended as required. Figure 1-5 depicts an example of \nLevel 3 process elements within a Level 2 process element \u2013 Resource Provisioning. Full descriptions \nof decompositions to Level 3 for this and other processes are included in the GB921 documentation. \n \nFigure 1-6: The Business Process Framework Strategy to Readiness (S2R) Processes \n\n\n \n \nStrategy to Readiness (S2R \u2013 see Figure 1-6) has a similar structure to OPS with corresponding vertical \nand horizontal process groupings. In the verticals, Strategy Management covers the processes \ninvolved in developing the enterprise strategy and gaining commitment from the sponsoring \norganization for this purpose. Capability Delivery covers design and implementation of all \nfoundational capabilities, including technology and infrastructure needed \u2013network and IT \ninfrastructure is probably the most obvious, but also human resources are part of the scope. \nLifecycle Management covers the lifecycle of products, services, resources and business partners\u2013 \nnote that the Business Process Framework distinguishes Product (as exposed and sold to Customers) \nfrom Service (used internally to represent the \u201ctechnical\u201d part of the product, i.e., excluding \ncommercial aspects such as tariffing, T&Cs, support, etc.) and Resource (physical and non-physical \ncomponents used to support the service). \n \nFigure 1-7:  Level 2 Strategy to Readiness (S2R) Processes \n \nIn Figure 1-7, the S2R area is shown with Level 2 processes visible. As with OPS, domains are \npositioned on a vertical process grouping. \n \n\n\n \n \nFigure 1-8:  The Business Process Framework Enterprise Domain Processes \nThe Enterprise Domain (see Figure 1-8) shown above as a hierarchical diagram is typically \nrepresented in this view in most process modeling tools supporting the Business Process Framework. \nThe top box is the Enterprise Domain itself (Level 1), the horizontal rows below show Level 2 \nprocesses elements. \n3.3 Process Flows \nProcess decompositions provide an essential insight into the process definition and content. To \nunderstand further how processes behave, process flows can be developed that examine how some \nor all of the processes support some larger, \u201cend-to-end\u201d or \u201cthrough\u201d process view across the \nenterprise. Such process flows are not constrained to bridge across the entire enterprise \u2013 they can \nhave any scope that is considered meaningful and helpful to analyze - but such process flows may \nalso involve a broader area of the enterprise as depicted in specific Business Process Framework \ndocumentation (e.g., GB921E). Process flows describe specific scenarios to achieve a specific \nbusiness purpose. \nFigure 1-9 shows a portion of a simple process flow, where several Business Process Framework \nLevel 2 OPS processes can be recognized, the linkages between these indicate the nature of the \nactivity. Note that here, as well as in other diagrams in this section, the flows are examples from \nprevious work from an older version of the Process Framework, but the approach and design \nprinciples, rather than the specificity of the flows illustrated is what the focus is on. \nIn the following example, a portion of the handling of a customer order is shown. \n\n\n \nFigure 1-9:  Process Flow (partial example only) \n \nThe process flow design has these general characteristics: \n\u2022 \nIt analyzes a typical (specific) scenario \n\u2022 \nIt provides insight into the behavior and interaction amongst processes \n\u2022 \nIt chooses to model the flow at an appropriate level of process detail \n\u2022 \nIt can use process decompositions to enhance/refine detail \n\u2022 \nThe aim is to provide only an example of the process flows - i.e., only some of the possible \ninteractions are described in each scenario \n\u2022 \nThus, it typically provides a partial view of process behavior (because flows are based on \nspecific scenarios)  \n\u2022 \nIt represents a dynamic perspective of processes. \n \nIn applying this approach for Business Process Framework process flows, it has been found that several \ndifferent flow-related diagram types have proved useful, considering the variety of interests (business and \ntechnical, high level and detailed design) that needs to be addressed. \nThis is initially a general positioning type of diagram that provides limited insight into the flow but helps focus \non the contextual part of the Business Process Framework involved."}

This shows some of the process interactions that arise for this scenario but does not give any \ndetailed insight at this level into the behavior. It is still useful for a high-level view, though. \n \nFigure 1-11:  Process Interaction Flow Diagram for Production Order to Acceptance \n \nThe next diagram type, shown in Figure 1-11, is developed directly from a process analysis and \nmodeling tool (rather than a general drawing software). Here the scope is with Level 2 process \nelements, but other Levels can be used depending on the detail required. This diagram type positions \nthe processes in relatively the same way as in their representation on the Business Process \nFramework model diagrams, which helps avoid confusion. Each process only appears once, and so \nsequencing of the interactions is not explicit in this diagram (shown on process dynamics diagrams \nlater). \n\n\nSwim lanes  are an important element in this type of workflow diagram. These are functional lanes \nof partitions of the process flow, which depict typically where the responsibility lies in those process \nelements with respect to the overall process flow (each swim-lane represents a line of responsibility \nfor the tasks involved in such lane). In this example, the swim lanes have been drawn to represent \nthe four horizontal functional process groupings of the Operations area of the Process Framework, \nsince the scenario involved is focused on the Operations domain. In this arrangement, all the process \nelements in a specific swim lane in the diagram are components of that horizontal functional process \ngrouping. It should be noted that swim lanes (despite their name) need not be only horizontal, \nalthough this is a common choice for clarity, and is the approach used in the Business Process \nFramework process flow diagrams. \nThe process flow in Figure 1-11 addresses the Production Order to Acceptance stage of Fulfillment \n(other phases are documented in separate diagrams, for convenience). It begins with the Service \nConfiguration & Activation process. Note that interactions between processes are events and are \nnot intrinsically information transfers. Thus, they can be considered to represent transfer of control.  \n \n \nFigure 1-12:  Process Interaction Flow Diagram for Trouble Ticket-to-Solution (Assurance) \n \nFigure 1-12 is another example of this diagram type, for the Trouble Ticketing process part of \nAssurance. It begins with the generation of a trouble ticket request or event, and then tracks the \nexecution flow through Service Problem Management, Resource Trouble Management and the \nBusiness Partner domain which may actually be involved in the delivery of the service to the \ncustomer. \nHowever, even though interactions are labeled in these diagrams, sequencing and dependencies in \nthe flow are still not explicit. For this, a different kind of diagram is needed. \n\n\n \nFigure 1-13:  Process Dynamics Flow Diagram for Trouble Ticket-to-Solution (Assurance) \n \nFigure 1-13 represents a process flow diagram, showing explicitly the dynamics of the process . Each \nprocess typically appears several times, each time providing a specific step in the process flow \nsequence. As different functionality comes into play on each appearance, this diagram can provide \ninsight into the decomposition of the Level 2 process into more granular processes. It shows similar \ninformation as the Trouble Ticketing process interaction diagram of Figure 1-12, but it is more \nelaborate and provides a broader basis for further design. \nDeveloping process flows in this way is a valuable source of insight and additional detail to validate \nprocess decompositions, and to address specific areas of business priority for the use of the Business \nProcess Framework. \nThe adoption of the Process Framework in no way precludes the adoption of specific best practice \nworkflows such as those available in ITIL\u00ae which provides workflow designs according to global IT \nService Management standards along with suggested best practices. The value of the Business \nProcess Framework is therefore in delivering reusable, well defined, process components. \n\n\n4. Why use the Business Process Framework? \n\u2022 \nThe Framework provides a standard structure, terminology and classification scheme for \ndescribing business processes and their constituent building blocks. \n\u2022 \nThe Framework supplies a foundation for applying enterprise-wide discipline to the \ndevelopment of business processes. \n\u2022 \nThe Framework provides a basis for understanding and managing portfolios of IT applications \nin terms of business process requirements. \n\u2022 \nThe Framework enables creation of consistent and high-quality end-to-end process flows, \nwith opportunities for cost and performance improvement, and for re-use of existing \nprocesses and systems. \n\u2022 \nThe deployment and adoption of the Framework across the industry increases the likelihood \nthat standard, interoperable, application components will be integration-ready at a lower cost \nthan traditional off-the-shelf or custom-built applications. \n\n\n5. When can the Business Process Framework \nhelp? \nThe Business Process Framework can be adopted and used as a tool for analyzing your organization\u2019s \nexisting processes and for developing new processes. Different processes delivering the same business \nfunctionality can be identified, duplication eliminated, gaps revealed, new process design expedited, \nand variance reduced. The Business Process Framework can prove helpful in assessing the value, cost \nand performance of individual processes within your organization. \n \nThe Business Process Framework can facilitate communication and interactions with suppliers and \nbusiness partners by identifying and categorizing the processes that are relevant for such interactions. \nIn a similar manner, the Business Process Framework can facilitate the identification of important \ncustomer relationship processes and evaluate whether they are functioning as required to meet \ncustomer expectations."}

Who is using the Business Process Framework? \nA natural question that arises is where and how the Business Process Framework is being used \nacross the industry and how it is benefiting organizations involved. It is difficult to collect very \ndetailed information about the use and benefits derived from its adoption across the industry, this \nis due to confidentiality concerns and sensitivity on strategic approach and direction; however, \nseveral major organizations have disclosed their position on this matter publicly, and the general \ninterest and adoption of the Business Process Framework has been quite significant over the years \nand the perception is that the trend is still growing. \n \nThe two main groups of Business Process Framework users are (1) Service Providers and (2) \nVendors, System Integrators, etc. It is worth noting that it is estimated that there is a much larger \nnumber of organizations applying the Process Framework in their businesses, and also a large \nnumber of organizations using the Process Framework, who are either not actively involved with \nthe TM Forum, or even unknown to the Forum. \n \nA vital source of insight on users and projects linked with the TM Forum work and related assets \nis the growing number of available case studies outlining how individual companies have applied \nthe framework. Many of these relate to the Business Process Framework (often using the \u201ceTOM\u201d \nacronym); some of the case studies can be viewed through the following link: \n \nhttp://www.tmforum.org/CaseStudies \n \nAnother important source is the presentations made at conference events such as Digital \nTransformation World (see http://www.tmforum.org/Conferences) \n \nAnother aspect of Business Process Framework adoption is through other industry bodies that are \noperating in, or have influence on, the area. For example, the Business Process Framework has \nbeen endorsed by ITU-T. This represents a major achievement and establishes the Business \nProcess Framework (eTOM), which has grown already to become a de facto standard, as a formal \nstandard Recommendation (identified as M.3050) through ITU-T with its mandate under the \nUnited Nations. \n \n \n\n\n7. Some Ideas on Using the Business Process \nFramework \nService Providers \n1. Assign your technical personnel to review the Business Process Framework and Model, and \nto present recommendations on adopting it for your enterprise (see www.tmforum.org for \ndownload advice). \n2. Encourage your vendors to understand the Business Process Framework, and. to describe \ntheir software applications in relation to the Business Process Framework. \n3. If you want your company\u2019s view incorporated in future versions of the Business Process \nFramework, send a representative to participate actively in its ongoing development. \nVendors \n1. Provide references on your software products for customers using the Business Process \nFramework structure and concepts. \n2. Assist your customers\u2019 understanding of your software products by explaining your software \nproducts in relation to the Business Process Framework. \n3. Use the Business Process Framework as a guide to help generate product gap analysis, market \nanalysis, competitive analysis, etc. \n4. Establish and build partnerships to produce more complete solutions for service providers. \n5. Leverage the Business process framework to deliver reusable, and thus more affordable, \nsolutions and products based on other best practices such as ITIL\u00ae, TOGAF\u00ae, COBIT\u00ae and others. \n6. To ensure the Business Process Framework accurately reflects how the telecom business \noperates, send a representative to participate in its ongoing development. \nNote: Vendors, System Integrators and related companies are generally comprised of common roles. \nThe common roles are shown below with a brief description of each role. These common roles are \nnot prescriptive. Rather, they are provided to illustrate the breadth of the Business Process \nFramework impact on vendor and system integrator organizational roles. \n\u2022 \nSenior Management: \no Mission & strategy \n\u2022 \nBusiness: \no Customer, market needs & issues \no Portfolio generation & management \no Value proposition \no Business case development \no Partnerships \n\u2022 \nMarketing: \no Market & competitive analysis \no Branding, advertising, promotions, etc. \no\nPublic relations\n\n\n\u2022 \nSales: \no RFQs, RFIs, RFPs, contracts, etc. \n\u2022 \nFinance: \no Revenue & cost forecasting \no Order to cash, billing, etc. \n\u2022 \nSystems Engineering: \no Research and Design \no System design: architecture, interfaces, etc. \no Technology, etc. roadmaps \n\u2022 \nDevelopment Engineering: \no Hardware, software, services products and solutions \n\u2022 \nTest: \no System, product, field, compliance, \u201cX-ility\u201d (Availability, Operability, \u2026), etc. testing & \ncertification \n\u2022 \nManufacturing: \no Supply chain (in) \no Warranty, etc. \n\u2022 \nDeployment: \no Supply chain (out) \no Delivery & installation \no Acceptance test \no Field trials, Field problem resolution, MOL \n \nBringing the Business Process Framework into your Business \u2013 Some hints and Suggestions \nTo evaluate and use the Business Process Framework for your own business, it is essential that the \nground is prepared so that the goals are clear, and it is possible to assess the impact of this. \nAs a first step, it is important to gain internal commitment and sponsor support for the adoption of \nthe Business Process Framework, since the kind of business process analysis, and possible changes \nthat will result, need buy-in and active participation from those involved. A critical success factor is \nobtaining senior management recognition and support. \nIt is also critical to identify and assess the area(s) where the Process Framework may bring benefit, \nand to define success criteria for any trial or pilot use, so that results can be leveraged to build \nconfidence and justify further work. \nIn using the Business Process Framework, it is important to recognize that it provides a ready-made \ngeneric business process framework, which may need adapting for your business, and that it is \nprogressively being further developed to lower-level detail. \nThe Business Process Framework can be used directly: \n\u2022 \nto assist your business partitioning (Process groupings and definitions to define \nroles and responsibilities within your organization) \n\u2022 \nto procure solutions from vendors that identify which processes within the \nP\nF\nk\nb i\nt d"}
