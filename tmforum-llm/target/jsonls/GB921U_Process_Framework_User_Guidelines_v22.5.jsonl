It is intended to \nprovide users of the Business Process Framework (eTOM) with guidelines and information to assist them in \napplying the Business Process Framework within their businesses. \n \n21.5 Release notice \nPLEASE NOTE: \nBecause of some major adjustments to domains in ODA and additional structural changes to the Business \nProcess Framework, significant amendments to diagrams and text has commenced. It is expected to be \ncompleted in subsequent releases. The interim state may cause inconsistencies in this and other ODA \ndocuments. Specifically, there are known diagram depictions, term conflicts, and numbering issues that are \nbeing addressed. \n \n\n\n1. Introduction \nThis document explains the design decisions of the Business Process Framework and sets out the \nprinciples for its application and extension in the form of Guidelines. These Guidelines are of use in two \nparticular cases. First, for the practitioner or process architect who wants to apply the Business Process \nFramework in a consistent way to specific situations. Second, for assurance of auditing and traceability, \nin order to produce repeatable application of the Business Process Framework within an organization \nand to demonstrate this externally for audit purposes. \nIt also provides a basis for contributors to the Business Process Framework and the evaluation of \ncontributions by the Business Process Framework team. Note that the concepts in this document have \nemerged throughout the development lifecycle of the Business Process Framework itself, and as a \nconsequence, historical design decisions that are embedded within the Business Process Framework \nmay deviate from the recommended practice herein that is intended to guide ongoing users of the \nFramework. The intent is to converge the practice here with the Business Process Framework as it is \ndeveloped further, but users should recognize that this will be an evolving situation. \nIt is intended that the guidance in this document will be augmented through user experience and \nfeedback. A list of outstanding issues is included. \n1.1  Audience \nThe intended audience for the Guidelines is practitioners, process architects, and process \nauditors. The material here is advanced material - it is not introductory (as that information is \navailable elsewhere in the Business Process Framework set). \n1.2  Plan of document \nThe document is set out as follows: \n\uf0d8 The principles and positions of the Business Process Framework model \n\uf0d8 Process patterns \n\uf0d8 Relationship of the Business Process Framework to ODA and the ODA elements \n\uf0d8 Business Process Framework and an organization\u2019s own processes \n\uf0d8 Guidance for extending and using the Business Process Framework \n\uf0d8 Audit checklist \n \n \n\n\n1.3  Principles and Guidelines \nThe principles are shown in the following format. Optionally, a Best Practice Guideline is \nindicated where a recommendation is made about the way in which the Business Process \nFramework should be applied. Requirements for auditing purposes are also shown in this \nformat. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework.nn \nBusiness Process Framework is ... \n \n\n\n2. Principles and positions of the Business Process \nFramework model \n2.1  Introduction \nThis section sets out to position the Business Process Framework as a process framework and \nto make explicit the modeling and design choices which have been followed in its development. \n2.2 A note on the status of the Business Process Framework documentation \nThe Business Process Framework consists of both normative and non-normative material. The \nnormative material is the Standard; the non-normative material is included for information and \nguidance. In general, GB921, with its Annexes and Addenda is normative material; Appendices \nand Application Notes are non-normative. Process Descriptions in Addendum D and DX, \nProcess Flow Examples in Addendum F and E are all normative. Other TMF documents, such as \nGB939 (Business Services Examples), which include Business Process Framework material, are \nnon-normative. \nThere is, however, an important distinction between the Process Elements (PEs), presented in \nAddendum D and DX, and the Process Flows, presented in Addendum F and E. Both are \nnormative, i.e., part of the Standard, but the Process Elements are comprehensive in scope \nwhile the Process Flows are examples. \n2.3  Nature of the Business Process Framework model \nThe Business Process Framework is a set of Process Elements, which are organized into a \nhierarchical framework. The Process Elements are activity-based, and the Business Process \nFramework is thus an activity-based process decomposition model. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 01 \nBusiness Process Framework is an activity/task-based process decomposition model. \n \nThe Process Elements in the Business Process Framework are intended as an exhaustive list; \nthey are comprehensive in scope. It is the intent that all business activities and tasks in the \nEnterprise can be supported by (i.e., are able to fit within) the Business Process Framework \nProcess Elements. Each Process Element has a detailed description that can include the \npurpose, inputs, outputs, interfaces, high level information and functional requirements and \nbusiness rules."}

It contains processes, \nnot states. For example, it contains process definition and decomposition for the processes of \nOrder Handling but does not model the different states of an Order. \n 2.4 Process model types \nIn general, there are 3 approaches to the modeling of business processes. It is also possible to \nuse a hybrid of these approaches. The general approaches are: \n\uf0d8 activity-based process modeling \n\uf0d8 communication-based process modeling  \n\uf0d8 artifact-based process modeling  \n \nActivity-based process modelling \nHere the overall process is decomposed into tasks that are ordered based on the dependencies \namong them. The fundamental entity of a business process for the Activity-based approach is \nthe unit of work and a business process is considered to be a succession of activities, or units \nof work, following a specific control flow.  \nDefinition: Activity \nAn activity represents a unit of work performed by a party or system. Activities transform inputs \ninto outputs and are associated with triggers and outcomes (pre and post conditions).  \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 03 \nA Business Process Framework Process Element is a succession of activities with a \ncontrol flow. \n \nCommunication-based Process Modelling \nIn this approach, an action in a process flow is represented by the communication that flows \nfrom a provider toward a consumer (In process improvement, a SIPOC is a tool that summarizes \nthe \ninputs \nand \noutputs \nof \none \nor \nmore \nprocesses \nin \nterms \nof: \nSupplier=>Input=>Process=>Output=>Consumer). In the communication-based approach the \ncommunication is the message. So, a business process can be expressed as an exchange of \nmessages, or transaction, between two or more roles and every state change within a company \ncan be associated with the processing of a message.  \n\n\nIn the artifact-based approach objects, or artifacts, are created, modified and used during the \nprocess and thus the model is based on work products and their paths through a series of \nworkflow activities.  \nHybrid approach to Process Modelling \nThe hybrid approach uses a combination of these general approaches to produce a set of \nmodels for an organization\u2019s processes. Typical models might be based on an information flow \nmodel (from the communication-based approach), a capabilities model (from the artifact-\nbased approach) and a process-model (activity-based approach).  \n2.5 Characteristics of a Business Process \nIn general, a Business Process will have the following characteristics: \n\uf0d8 It has a goal \n\uf0d8 It has specific inputs \n\uf0d8 It has specific outputs \n\uf0d8 It transforms inputs into outputs \n\uf0d8 It uses resources \n\uf0d8 It has several activities that are performed in some order \n\uf0d8 It creates value of some kind for the customer. The customer may be internal or \nexternal. \nIn addition: \n\uf0d8 It may affect more than one organizational unit - \u201cHorizontal organizational \nimpact\u201d \n\uf0d8 Its effects on information entities can be analyzed via CRUD (Create / Read / \nUpdate / Delete) \n\uf0d8 It may have a responsibility model for the roles associated with the process, \nexpressible as RACI Characteristics (Responsible / Accountable / Consulted / \nInformed) \nFor a Business Process Framework Process Element: \n\uf0d8 Goal is stated. \n\uf0d8 Inputs may be defined. \n\uf0d8 Outputs may be defined.  \n\uf0d8 Resources consumed may be defined.   \n\uf0d8 Activities may be specified within description \n\uf0d8 Value should be stated. \n\uf0d8 Effect on organizational use may be stated \n\uf0d8 CRUD analysis may be available \n\n\n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 04 \n(Best Practice): a Business Process Framework Process Element has a goal, an implied \npurpose or value proposition, inputs, outputs. It consists of activities/tasks and uses \nresources. It may have a CRUD and a RACI model. \n2.6 Decomposition \nDefinition: Decomposition \nDecomposition is the breaking-down of a process into simpler activities. \nThe Business Process Framework is a decomposition model from a notional Level 0 through to \nLevel 4, and beyond (some Level 5 process elements are now defined and are being \nincorporated). Additionally, many individual users are developing lower-level decompositions \nthat extend the Business Process Framework beyond the industry-agreed level (and in due \ncourse these may feedback to extend the level of industry agreement). In order to keep the \nBusiness Process Framework to a level which is generally useful it is not intended to decompose \nthe Business Process Framework (i.e., as managed through the TM Forum) indefinitely. It is \nasserted that the further a decomposition is taken, the more difficult it is to prove the \nuniqueness of lower level processes. However, the level at which it becomes unproductive to \nextend further is not yet clear, and so decomposition continues to proceed in line with the \nindustry\u2019s priorities and available effort. \n \nNote:  \nThe relationship and mapping of these Business Process Framework Levels to an organization\u2019s \nown processes and procedures is addressed in a later section \u201cOrganizational Context for the \nBusiness Process Framework\u201d. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 05 \nThe Business Process Framework is decomposed from notional Level 0 to more granular \nlevels \u2013 Levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 (and some of levels 5 and 6) are addressed so far. An agreed \nendpoint (i.e., a level below which decomposition does not proceed) is not yet defined. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 06 \nIt is not the purpose of the Business Process Framework to address the detailed \nprocesses and procedures of an enterprise. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 07 \n\n\nrepresent particular priorities have been decomposed further into level 4 and below)."}
{"tmforumApiId": "GB921U", "id": "GB921U-chunk-5", "chunkIndex": 5, "totalChunks": 12, "apiName": "Process Framework User Guidelines v22.5", "title": "GB921U_Process_Framework_User_Guidelines_v22.5 (Part 5/12)", "documentType": "Tmforum api user guide", "text": "2.7 Traceability \nBecause the Business Process Framework is a decomposition model, the lower levels of the \ndecomposition can be traced back to the higher levels. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 08 \nThe goals, inputs, outputs, and activities of decomposed Process Elements at a lower \nlevel are consistent with the higher-level Process Element. In particular, the input of the \nfirst lower level Process Element is the same as the input of the higher level Process \nElement; the output from the last lower level Process Element is the same as the output \nof the higher level Process Element; the detailed goals of the lower level Process \nElements taken together should match the goal of the higher level Process Element; the \nactivities of the lower level Process Elements taken together should match the activity of \nthe higher level Process Element. \n2.8 Process dependency through information \nBusiness processes do not exist in isolation. Processes require information from other \nprocesses, and they in turn provide information to other processes. Dependencies (or \nassociations) between processes occur when an activity requires information from another \nactivity. Process dependencies are related to the entities and attributes required by the \nbusiness area. The importance of analyzing and modeling dependencies is to provide further \nunderstanding of the interaction between processes and data. \nNote:  \nAn exercise has been underway for several years to map the Information Framework (SID) ABEs \n(Aggregate Business Entities) which are associated with Business Process Framework Process \nElements. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 09 \n(Best Practice): each Business Process Framework Process Element should identify its \nassociated Information Framework ABEs. \n2.9 Grouping / organization within the Business Process Framework \nThe Business Process Framework is a classification or taxonomy of Process Elements. At Level \n0 the elements are classified into S2R (Strategy to Operations) and Operations. Lower Levels \nare formed by decomposition with each Process Element occurring once only. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 10 \n\n\nthere is no replication. \n2.10 Flows \nAmongst the various flows that are characteristic in most organizations, there are three that \nare fundamental in the context of the Business Process Framework, namely the information \nflow, the material flow and the control flow. \n\uf0d8 The information flow concerns the flow of data or information, e.g., the \ninformation on an order as it is progressed; these can also be message flows.  \n\uf0d8 The material flow concerns the actual physical items e.g., the items which \nconstitute the order.  \n\uf0d8 The control flow (or workflow) defines the logic of business processes i.e., the \nenterprise behavior in terms of a sequence or order in which enterprise activities \nmust be performed to achieve business objectives.  \nThe definition of the Business Process Framework Process Elements themselves does not \naddress these types of flow. However, the Business Process Framework does include a couple \nof Addenda: E and F; sample process flows and depictions of process interaction in swim lanes. \nThese are examples of control flow. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 11 \nProcess flow examples in Business Process Framework are control flows, defining the \nsequence in which activities are performed. \nNote:  \nTraceability also applies to swim lanes in Business Process Framework process flows. (See \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 08) \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 12 \nThe swim lanes in a process flow are consistent within themselves and with \nrespect to lower level decompositions. \n2.11 Dynamic aspects of Process Modeling \nThe Business Process Framework Process Elements and example process flows are a process view \nof the enterprise behavior, based on sequences of activity. However, there are also dynamic \naspects pertaining to the processes and their interaction. These are considered below. \n \n\uf0d8 Temporal aspects \n\n\nfrequencies and possible delays between process steps. Process step durations \n(minimum, maximum, average durations) can also be indicated \n\uf0d8 Co-operative activities  \nIn practice, it is common that two or more activities of two different processes must \nwork co-operatively, e.g., to exchange messages or objects. Methods include message \npassing and patterns. \n\uf0d8 Process communication \nIn the case where processes must communicate, this means that some activities of \none process must interact with activities of other processes. The previous mechanisms \nfor co-operative activities can be used. \n\uf0d8 Process synchronization \nProcess synchronization can happen in three different forms: (1) synchronization by \nevents, (2) synchronization by messages and (3) synchronization by object flows.  \n\uf0d8 Exception handling mechanisms \nProcess models often only model the ideal structure of a business process. Real-world \nsituations mostly consist of dealing with exceptions. Exceptions can either be \npredictable or unpredictable.  \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework.13 \nBusiness Process Framework models success scenarios (sunny days). Error conditions \nare not in scope. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework.14 \nDynamic aspects of process modelling (e.g., workflow diagramming and sequential \nflows) are outside the scope of the Business Process Framework. \n2.12 Naming conventions \nThe preferred convention for naming Level 3 Process Elements is <Verb Noun> e.g., \u201cConfigure \n& Activate Resource\u201d, \u201cDetermine pre-order feasibility\u201d, \u201cClose Problem\u201d. This is also the \npreferred convention for naming Process Elements at lower levels of decomposition (i.e., Level \n4 and below)  \nThe preferred convention for naming events is <Noun Verb> e.g., \u201cWork Orders Executed\u201d, \n\u201cResource Allocation & Configuration Done\u201d. \nNote: Level 1 and Level 2 Process Names have not in the past used the convention above. \nRenaming existing Level 1 and Level 2 process elements is seen as unnecessarily disruptive and \nso the existing form (typically, <Noun> e.g., \u201cParty Relationship Development & Retirement\u201d, \n\u201cOrder Handling\u201d) has been retained. New or modified process elements at Level 1 and/or \nLevel 2 should continue to use this existing convention, so that there is consistency in the \nnaming within a Level"}

Responsibility for association / translation between layers is generally \npositioned at the lower layer. For example, the Customer layer in the Operations area manages \nCustomer Problems and the Service layer in the Operations area manages the Service Problems \nthat may be associated, but it is the responsibility of the processes in the Service domain to \nmap between these Service Problems. \nThus, the Customer domain in the Operations area provides the Customer Problem (or some \nappropriate information from this) to the Service domain, which must then associate the one \n(or more) Service Problems that derive from this Customer Problem. Any ongoing interaction \nbetween Customer and Service layers is therefore in terms of Customer Problems (or \ninformation based on these) and not Service Problems, which are managed wholly within the \nService layer. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 16 \nResponsibility for association / translation between layers is generally positioned at the \nlower layer. \n2.14 Data Responsibility \nThe process, which is managing data creation, update etc. has a prime responsibility for \nensuring that the results of data which it is manipulating via the process are appropriately \nstored. \n \nPrinciple Business Process Framework - 17 \nA process has prime responsibility for ensuring that the results of data manipulation are \nstored appropriately. \n \n \n\n\n3. Process Patterns \n3.1 Introduction \nIn this section are presented examples of decomposition patterns in the Business Process \nFramework. These patterns serve as templates for process modeling in the particular process \narea. Patterns are identified at Level 3 for: \n\uf0d8 Problem Reports and their resolution \n\uf0d8 Strategic view and Business Plan \n\uf0d8 Order Lifecycle \n\uf0d8 Product Lifecycle \nNote: \nAll Patterns should have associated Use Cases. Use Cases will be added in a later version of the \ndocument. \n3.2 Level 3 patterns \nExample 1 \u2013 Problem Reports and their resolution \nApplicable to ASSURANCE: Customer Problem Handling / Service Problem Management / \nResource Trouble Management. \nThis pattern consists of 4 process steps and 2 continuous processes. The process steps are: \n\uf0d8 \u201cCreate\u201d. e.g., Problem Report, Trouble Report, Resource Trouble. \n\uf0d8 \u201cAnalyze\u201d. Diagnose root cause. \n\uf0d8 \u201cFix\u201d. Correct & Recover through recovery activities. \n\uf0d8 \u201cClose\u201d. Problem resolved, close report.  \nWith 2 processes running continuously: \n\uf0d8 \u201cTrack & Manage recovery activities\u201d \n\uf0d8 \u201cReport\u201d \nPre-condition / Inputs to this pattern are: a reported problem or an alarm or event at resource \nor service level. \nPost-condition / Output is: resolved problem, restoration of normal operation. \nAssociated Use Case: \nExample 2 \u2013 Strategic view and Business Plan \nApplicable to Strategy Management: Service Strategy & Planning / Resource Strategy & \nPlanning / Party Strategy & Planning \n\n\n\uf0d8 \u201cResearch\u201d. Research & analyses, including management of research gathering. \n\uf0d8 \u201cStrategy\u201d.

Organizational Context for the Business Process \nFramework \n4.1 Introduction \nThis section sets out the enterprise context for process modeling, and the ways in which the \nBusiness Process Framework is applied. This section is not a guide on how to do process \nmodeling in an organization, rather it sets out a generic framework for the various types of \nprocess (including manual human procedures) within a typical enterprise and shows how the \nBusiness Process Framework can be related to those organizational processes. \n4.2 Use of the Business Process Framework within an organization \nThe use of the Business Process Framework by organizations involves the extension and \nrefinement of the Business Process Framework to meet the specific business, operational, \nsystem and deployment needs of the organization. \nThis section is based on the following view of how processes are developed and modeled within \norganizations, and the relationship of the process models to organization structures and \nsystems developments. \n \n\n\n \nFigure 4-1 - Process Hierarchy \nPLEASE NOTE: As of release 14.5 of Frameworx it is acceptable for a core process to decompose \nto other core process. Thus, multi-level core processes are being added to the Business Process \nFramework.  \nThe best to way to structure a large amount of content and detail, while still allowing the \nhigher-level views to present a summary view, is to structure the information in multiple Levels, \nwhere each Level is decomposed into greater detail at the next lower Level. This is Hierarchical \nDecomposition. \nBy having the Business Process Framework structured into multiple Levels it enables users of \nthe framework to align their enterprise framework or their process implementations with the \nBusiness Process Framework at different levels e.g., Align at Level 1 and 2 or align at Level 1, 2 \nand 3. \nTo summarize how levels are used in the Business Process Framework. \n \nLevel 0 The whole Enterprise view (The entire Business Process Framework) as seen with its \nProcess Areas and Domains altogether \nLevel 1 Domains (horizontal) represent a Level 1 view along with the seven Context Verticals \n(previously referred to as Vertical Process Groupings). \nLevel 2 All the Process Elements (aka Core Processes, e.g., Order Handling) which populate \nhorizonal domains across the eTOM are Level 2."}

The benefit of these \nguidelines is that different enterprises will use a similar analysis approach to apply the Business \nProcess Framework to their own organization. \n\n\n5. Guidance for extending and using the Business \nProcess Framework \nBecause of the changes in domains and additional structural changes to the Business Process \nFramework, significant amendments to diagrams and text has commenced \n5.1 Process Hierarchy: Decomposition Principles \nTraditionally Level 0 elements in the Business Process Framework (eTOM) have been known as \nPAs (Process Areas) there were three PAs in the eTOM until version 14.5: SIP (Strategy, \nInfrastructure & Product), Ops (Operations) and EM (Enterprise Management). Process Areas \nas such, are not (directly) aligned with business objectives, value streams or balance scorecards; \nProcess Areas represent a partitioning or highest-level classification of processes of the \nenterprise. \nCurrently there are two Process Areas left in the eTOM, these are: S2R (Strategy to Readiness) \nand Operations. Since version 14.5 the EM (Enterprise Management) Process Area has become \nthe seventh horizontal domain in the framework and has been renamed \u201cEnterprise\u201d instead \nof \u201cEnterprise Management\u201d; the \u2018Common\u2019 transversal domain has been removed from the \nframework and its constituents refactored and distributed .across various horizontal domains \nas appropriate. \nIn the past, Process Groupings represented by the 8 former horizontal domains and the 7 \nverticals (known also as lifecycles in earlier times) were a way of decomposing and structuring \n(Level 0) Process Areas into the next level of detail (Level 1s for the horizontal process \ngroupings), these are currently seven single horizontal (Level-1) process groupings and one \n(Level-1) vertical; these are all better known as domains: 1) Market & Sales, 2) Customer, 3) \nProduct, 4) Service, 5) Resource, 6) Business Partner, 7) Enterprise. \nCore processes can be multi-level, typically they are Level 2 but there can be Level 3 core \nprocesses (although less common) and even Level 4 core processes. Core processes break \ndown into Tasks. \nLevel 3s, Level 4s, Level 5s, Level 6s, etc. are typically known as Tasks in the eTOM, although \nsome process models e.g., APQC define a different way of decomposition in which Level 1 \n(Categories) decompose into Level 2 (process groupings) which decompose into Level 3 \n(processes) which themselves decompose into Level 4 (activities) which decompose into Level \n5 (tasks), but that is a different perspective. In fact, there are hundreds of different process \nmodels across all industry sectors and enterprises, some are standard, some are proprietary, \nand their structure can vary significantly, but the Business Process Framework (eTOM) provides \na good balance in terms of structure and decomposition, due to its level of maturity, (telecoms) \nindustry adoption and popularity, it is now being positioned more and more to be relevant to \nthe full spectrum of the service provider industry, well beyond telecoms. \n \n\n\n6. Decomposition Guidelines \nBefore providing a set of decomposition guidelines the properties of a process are provided.  Each \nframework process may have one or more of these properties.  As enterprise specific extensions are \nmade to the framework, these properties should become part of the overall specification of the added \nprocesses. \nA process specification consists of: \n\u2022 \nA stated goal that the process achieves \nin terms of a purpose or result from applying the process \n\u2022 \nInputs that may be defined \n\u2022 \nOutputs that may be defined \nNote that inputs transform to outputs through the process \nfunctionality/behavior  \n\u2022 \nResources consumed that may be defined \nNote for the Business Process Framework, resources may be defined \nthrough linkages with the Information Framework \n\u2022 \nActivities/Tasks into which the process decomposes that may be defined \nThese may be embedded in the process description \n\u2022 \nA stated or implied value/benefit within the business \nMay be related to how the process is used within a particular enterprise \n\u2022 \nCreate, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) analysis that may be available \nThis can link with the Information Framework \n\u2022 \nResponsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed (RACI) analysis that may be \navailable \nTypically, this is related to how processes are mapped into organizations \n\u2022 \nKey Performance / Quality Indicators (KPIs/KQIs) \n \nThese characteristics apply to all levels including extensions and should be included in the \ndefinition/description of the process.   \nA process transforms inputs into outputs. The activities into which it decomposes are \nperformed in some order.  The value is created for the customer. The customer may be internal \nor external."}

Nouns, \noften nouns and/or gerunds (a noun form of a verb), such as Fulfilment, Billing and Revenue \nManagement, Customer Problem Handling are used for L1 and L2 processes.  This convention \nindicates a higher-level process that is a combination of tasks (L3). The <verb noun> convention \nare used for processes that represent more discrete processes, such as tasks (L3, L4, L5, etc). \nNote that L3, L4, L5 refer to the levels within a process hierarchy and that there may be multiple \nlevels of Business Process Framework process that represent a given process hierarchy level. A \nbit confusing, but the focus of the Business Process Framework process must be considered \nwhen classifying a Business Process Framework process within the levels of a process hierarchy. \nAssociation/translation between process layers, horizontal Business Process Framework \nprocesses, is the responsibility of the lower layer.  For example, the interaction from \nCustomer Problem Handling to Service Problem Management is expressed in terms a \nCustomer Problem Report. It is the responsibility of Service Problem Management, not \nCustomer Problem Handling, to create the Service Problem Report(s) and associate the \nReport(s) to the Customer Problem Report. This in part helps ensure that the lifecycle of \nthe entity is managed by a single L2 process and is not split among more than one L2 \nprocess. \nThe process which manages data creation, update, and so forth has a prime responsibility for \nensuring that the results of data which it is manipulating via the process are appropriately \nstored. \nWhen decomposing a process to L3 or to L4, and sometimes below L4, it is helpful to think of \nthe next level of decomposition in terms which represents \u201clife cycle\u201d decomposition.  Life cycle \ndecomposition is a technique to use when identifying processes that move an object/entity \nthrough its life of interest to the business.  L3/L4 processes, each of which represents the task \nlevel within the process decomposition, naturally focus on a single state in the life cycle of an \nobject/entity.  Typical processes in the decomposition perform \u201cPlan\u201d, \u201cAcquire\u201d, \u201cUse\u201d, \n\u201cDispose\u201d tasks.  The set of tasks is typically made up of those that plan to use an object/entity, \nwhich acquires an object/entity, which uses an object/entity, and which disposes of an entity.  \nNote that life cycle decomposition is just one of the many techniques described here which \nmay be used to identify lower level process elements. \nThe lifecycle often depends on the category of entity.  Plan, Acquire, Use, Dispose processes \nmay take on names specific to the type of entities/objects upon which they act.  Shown below \nare some examples of the names associated with different categories of entities. \n\n\ncycle related processes: \n\u2022 \nGather/analyze \n\u2022 \nDevelop \n\u2022 \nDeploy \n\u2022 \nAssess \n\u2022 \nRetire. \nIntangible oriented entities, such as strategies and plans may have the following life cycle \nrelated processes: \n\u2022 \nResearch/analyze \n\u2022 \nFormulate/prepare \n\u2022 \nApprove/commit \n\u2022 \nAssess \n\u2022 \nRetire. \nActivity oriented entities, such as orders and problems may have the following life cycle related \nprocesses: \n\u2022 \nIssue/Create \n\u2022 \nAnalyze/diagnose \n\u2022 \nFix, monitor, correct \n\u2022 \nClose. \nNote that the actual decomposition may only consist of a subset of these types of activities.  \nThere are many examples of this type of decomposition in the framework. \nNote also that while products and services are intangible entities, they are typically realized by \nin part some type of physical (tangible) resource. The first set of sample process names \nrepresents processes that appear in the Lifecycle Management L1 vertical context; the second \nset represents processes that appear in the Strategy Management vertical.  The third set \nrepresents processes associated with activity-oriented entities that span Fulfilment and \nAssurance. \nFor example, the decomposition of the L2 Problem Handling includes Create Customer \nProblem Report (Acquire), Correct & Recover Customer Problem (Use), and Close Customer \nProblem Report (Dispose) represents processes that appear in the Assurance L1 context \nvertical. In this example there is no equivalent for the Plan process. \nBelow L2, beware \u201c/\u201d, \u201c&\u201d, and their variants in process names, which typically means process \nshould be split.  Although the Business Process Framework does not always follow the last \nguideline, processes whose names imply more than one process, such as Implement, \nConfigure, and Activate Service could be split into three processes at the next level of"}

A L2 process manages the life of a small number \nof ABEs.  For example, Service Configuration & Activation manages the life of the Service Order \nand Service ABEs as defined by the published Business Process Framework/Information \nFramework L2 to ABE mappings.  Customer Problem Handling manages the life cycle of a \nCustomer Problem Report.  The L3 processes focus on states within the life cycle of an ABE.  For \nexample, Issue Service Order focuses on the creation state; Close Service Order focuses on the \ncompletion state.  A similar relationship exists for the L3 processes that define Problem \nHandling.  Lower level processes deal with managing the states of the entities associated with \nthe L3 processes and no others. \nA process in one domain, such as Customer, Product, Service, does not create instances of \nentities in another domain. This guideline follows on from the layer\u2019s guideline.  For example, \nProblem Handling does not create instances of Service Problem Report.  Similarly, Order \nHandling does not create instances of Service Orders.  The two L2 processes reside within the \nCustomer and the Product domains (L1 horizontal process groupings) domains, while Service \nProblem Report and Service Order are Service domain entities. \n6.4 Semantic Analysis \nIn linguistics, semantic analysis is the process of relating syntactic structures, from the levels of \nphrases, clauses, sentences and paragraphs to the level of the writing as a whole, to their \nlanguage-independent meanings, removing features specific to particular linguistic and cultural \ncontexts, to the extent that such a project is possible. The elements of idiom (a fixed distinctive \nexpression whose meaning cannot be deduced from the combined meanings of its actual \nwords) and figurative speech, being cultural, must also be converted into relatively invariant \nmeanings. \nSemantic analysis is much like sentence diagramming that we all learned at an early age.  The \ndescriptions of L3 processes can be used and analyzed to begin identifying L4 processes. \nThis is accomplished by performing semantic analysis on the description of a process: \n\u2022 \nLook for nouns (entities) upon which actions are performed \n\u2022 \nLook for verbs that act on nouns (entities) \n\u2022 \nLook for phrases that imply actions on nouns (entities). \n\n\ninteract with the processes being identified. \nSemantic Analysis should be considered as just another of the many techniques described in \nthis section that can be used to decompose processes.  The techniques can be viewed as \nsupplemental to the techniques currently in use within an organization.  Often, Semantic \nAnalysis is carried out iteratively with other techniques and may result in updating the \ndescription of a process to which Semantic Analysis was originally applied.  The goal would be \nthat the final decomposition(s) are consistent with the parent process description(s) from a \nSemantic Analysis viewpoint. \nFor simple L3 processes whose description is brief, such as Close Service Performance \nDegradation Report and Audit Data Collection & Distribution, decomposition to L4 may not be \npossible.  Their descriptions are included here to illustrate this point. \nClose Service Performance Degradation Report - The objective of the Close Service \nPerformance Degradation Report processes is to close a service performance degradation \nreport when the service performance has been resolved. These processes monitor the status \nof all open service performance degradation reports and recognize that a service performance \ndegradation report is ready to be closed when the status is changed to clear.  \nAudit Data Collection & Distribution - The Audit Data Collection & Distribution processes are \nresponsible for auditing the management information & data collection activities in order to \nidentify possible anomalies such as loss of management information and/or data in the \ndifferent collection, processing and distribution steps. \nDecomposing from L3 Description Example 1 \u2013 Isolate Customer Problem \nIsolate Customer Problem is the L3 process being decomposed. \nThe purpose of the Isolate Customer Problem processes is to identify the root cause of the \ncustomer problem. The responsibilities of these processes include, but are not limited to: \nVerifying Configuration; and \nPerforming specific customer problem diagnostics based on the customer provided \ninformation to determine whether the root cause of the customer problem is linked to the \nunderlying services. \nThe Isolate Customer Problem processes will make the results of the root cause analysis \navailable to other processes. The Isolate Customer Problem processes will update open \ncustomer problem report, as required during the assessment, and when the root cause has \nbeen identified.  The Isolate Customer Problem processes will notify the Track & Manage \nCustomer Problem processes when the analysis is complete. \nThe highlighted text represents the candidate L4 processes using the semantic analysis \nguidelines described previously in this section.  Not all of the descriptions resulted in candidate \nL4 processes.  Some were used as part of the description of the L4s or represent the initiation \nof flows to other processes.  For example, the notification to Track & Manage Customer \nProblem is defined using a flow to that process; updating the open Customer Problem Report \nis also accomplished by initiating a flow to Track & Manage Customer Problem. \nNote that all the nouns (entities) deal with the Customer Problem ABE and its entities, such as \nRoot Cause."}

This example \nillustrates the work accomplished for the L3 processes for the L2 Customer Problem Handling \nprocess. Inputs and outputs were derived from the descriptions and implied actions on entities \ncontained in the descriptions of the L3 processes.  These, along with semantic analysis, \ndiscussed earlier in this chapter, were used to deduce the candidate L4 processes that will make \ntheir way into the framework. \nThe Inputs and outputs can be used to construct/confirm L3 and L4 process flow diagrams.  This \nprocess shows the work done that resulted in the Problem Handling decompositions. \n \n \nFigure 6-3 \u2013 Customer Problem Handling L4 Processes \n \n \n\n\nProvisioning L3 processes. \n \nFigure 6-4 - Resource Provisioning L4 Processes. \n \n \n \n\n\nManagement L3 processes. \n \nFigure 6-5 - 13 Resource Trouble Management L4 Processes \n \n \n\n\n7. Audit Checklist \nThis section contains a checklist of the Business Process Framework principles for its use and application within \nan organization. \n \nPrinciple \n \nBusiness Process \nFramework - 01 \nThe Business Process Framework is an activity-based process \ndecomposition model \nBusiness Process \nFramework - 02 \nThe Business Process Framework Process Elements are \ncomprehensive for a Service Provider \nBusiness Process \nFramework - 03 \nA Business Process Framework Process Element is a succession of \nactivities with a control flow \nBusiness Process \nFramework - 04 \n(Best Practice): A Business Process Framework Process Element has \na goal, value proposition, inputs, outputs. It consists of activities \nand uses resources. It has a CRUD and RACI model. \nBusiness Process \nFramework - 05 \nThe Business Process Framework is decomposed from notional \nLevel 0 to more granular levels \u2013 Levels 1, 2 and 3 (and some of \nlevel 4) are addressed so far. An agreed endpoint (i.e., a level \nbelow which decomposition does not proceed) is not yet defined. \nBusiness Process \nFramework - 06 \nIt is not the purpose of the Business Process Framework to address \nthe detailed processes and procedures of an enterprise \nBusiness Process \nFramework - 07 \nThe Enterprise Domain is generally decomposed to Level 3 only \n(but specific areas that represent particular priorities have been \ndecomposed further). \nBusiness Process \nFramework - 08 \nThe goals, inputs, outputs, and activities of decomposed Process \nElements at a lower level are consistent with the higher-level \nProcess Element. In particular, the input of the first lower level \nProcess Element is the same as the input of the higher level \nProcess Element; the output from the last lower level Process \nElement is the same as the output of the higher level Process \nElement; the goals of the lower level Process Elements taken \ntogether should match the goal of the higher level Process \nElement; the activities of the lower level Process Elements taken \ntogether should match the activity of the higher level Process \nElement."}
