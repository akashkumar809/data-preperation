It includes the model \ndefinition as well as all available operations. This API features several resources: \n\u2022 \nProduct Stock to describe a stock of a product. It features information related to quantity (in stock, min, max, \nreorder) but also Product configuration, place or related party. \n\u2022 \nAdjust Product Stock is a resource to request a product Sock quantity adjustment. A reason for adjustment \ncould be provided (for example liked to an inventory check) \n\u2022 \nCheck Product Stock is a task-based resource to check a product configuration availability at a place and a \ndate. It is possible for the server side to provide alternate option (if requested not available). \n\u2022 \nReserve Product Stock is used to perform a reservation for a product configuration. The requester could \nprovide a specific product stock to be used. A related entity could be provided to link the entity related to \nthis reservation (like a product order or quote for example). \n\u2022 \nQueryProductStock is a task-based resource to retrieve a list of Product Stock from a list of complex attribute \n(for example all product stock in a given state, in a place and available for a channel) \n \nStock Management API performs the following operations \n\u2026on Product Stock: \n\u2022 \nRetrieval of a product stock or a collection of product stock depending on filter criteria \n\u2022 \nPartial update of a product stock (including updating rules) \n\u2022 \nCreation of a product stock  \n\u2022 \nDeletion of product stock (for administration purposes) \n\u2022 \nNotification of events on product stock \no product stock creation \no product stock deletion \no product stock state change \no product stock batch \no product stock state change \n\u2026on AdjustProductStock, CheckProductStock, QueryProductStock and ReserveProductStock: \n\u2022 \nRetrieval of a resource depending on filter criteria \u2013 or by id. \n\u2022 \nCreation of a resource  \n\u2022 \nNotification of events  \no for creation \no for attribute value change \no for state change \no for batch"}

All Rights Reserved.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 8 of 150 \nSAMPLE USE CASES \n \nWe illustrate in this document several use-cases:  \n\u2022 \nFor product stock we illustrate a description of a stock of \u201cTMFPhone x-9\u201d in shop & available in the Lyon \nshop. We have all information related to this stock as min/max/reorder qty or next replenishment date. \n\u2022 \nFor adjust Product Stock we request to change previous product stock quantity following an inventory check. \n\u2022 \nFor check, a requester asks for an 128GB TMFPhone x-9 availability in the Lyon shop. This item is not available \nbut an alternate is available: a 256GB TMFPhone x-9. Because request is ok to get alternate this proposal is \nsent in the response. \n\u2022 \nFor reserve product Stock, we reserve this 256GB TMFPhone x-9 in the Lyon shop. The product order related \nto this reservation is part of the resource information. \n\u2022 \nFor query Product stock we look for TMFPhone x-9 available in a defined search zone- In the response we \nhave 2 shops listed with this product. \n\n\n\u00a9TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPage 9 of 150 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension  \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, \nfor instance a Stock or WarehouseStock inheriting properties from the base ProductStock entity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nProductStock instances some may be instances of Stock where other could be instances of WarehouseStock. The \n@type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a RelatedParty object) to explicitly denote \nthe actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class \ntype of the reference itself, such as RelatedParty, and not the class type of the referred object. However, since \nreference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been extended \n \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9TM Forum 2020.
