Page 8 of 27 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, \nfor instance a BankAccountTransfer and DigitalWallet inheriting properties from the abstract Payment Method \nentity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nPayment Method instances some may be instances of Cash where other could be instances of Bank Card. The @type \ngives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when \nthis is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance an AccountRef object) to explicitly denote \nthe actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class \ntype of the reference itself, such as BankAccountTransferRef or DigitalWalletRef, and not the class type of the \nreferred object. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference \nobjects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2021.

Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not \nsupport multiple listeners.
