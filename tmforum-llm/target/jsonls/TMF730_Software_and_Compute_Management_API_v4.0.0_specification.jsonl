Page 8 of 235 \nIntroduction \nThe following document is the user guide of the REST API for Software and Compute entity management. \nIt includes the model definition as well as all available operations. \nOverview \nThe Resource domain covers Physical and Logical managed entities.  Increasingly physical network \nappliances are being replaced by virtualized counterparts realized as software hosted on general purpose \ncomputing infrastructure.  It is important that these software entities form part of a management continuum \nwhere physical and logical resources are equally well enabled. \nThis API introduces the data schemas required to manage software and compute entities using the \nResource Domain Open APIs. \nConcepts \nThe basic building block concepts needed for managing software and compute entities are: \n\u2022 \nSoftware \n\u2022 \nFunction \n\u2022 \nConnection Point \n\u2022 \nProcess \n\u2022 \nHost \nSoftware is a computer program, a sequence of instructions in a programming language. A Function is a \ncapability of a software which transforms input(s) into output(s). A Connection Point makes input and/or \noutput for a Function available and may be realized by an application program interface (API).  A Process \nis an instance of execution of Software. A compute environment for software Processes is a Host. \nSoftware provides Functions which provide Connection Points. Any complex system may be decomposed \ninto an interconnected structure of these basic elements. \nData Model \nThe above concepts are realized with the data model depicted in Figure 1 below. The \nEntity/EntitySpecification pattern, common to the TM Forum Open API data model, is applied for each \nentity type. \nAn instance of InstalledSoftware represents one or more Processes which are either currently executing, \nor may potentially be executed in the future, and is described by a SoftwareSpecification.  \nResourceFunction instances are provided by InstalledSoftware and described by \nResourceFunctionSpecification. The Connection Point(s) of a ResourceFunction are realized by API \ninstances which are described by APISpecification. \n \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2023.

Page 9 of 235 \n \nFigure 1: Software and Compute Entity Relationships \n \nA SoftwareSpecification may reference an external SoftwareSupportPackage, which provides the files \ncontaining the programs required for instantiated Processes of the InstalledSoftware, and which may be \ndescribed by a SoftwareSupportPackageSpecification.  A HostingPlatformRequirement provides the \nrequirements on a Host which must be fulfilled to run the Software and is described by a \nHostingPlatformRequirementSpecification. \n \n \nFigure 2: Additional Entities and Relationships \nAPISpeci\ufb01cation\nResourceFunctionSpeci\ufb01cation\nSoftwareSpeci\ufb01cation\nprovides\nprovides\nAPI\nResourceFunction\nInstalledSoftware\nprovides\nprovides\ncomposedOf\ncomposedOf\nspeci\ufb01es\nspeci\ufb01es\nspeci\ufb01es\ncomposedOf\ncomposedOf\nHostingPlatformRequirementSpeci\ufb01cation\nSoftwareSupportPackage\nSoftwareSpeci\ufb01cation\nreferences\nuses\nInstalledSoftware\nHostingPlatformRequirement\nuses\nspeci\ufb01es\nSoftwareSupportPackageSpeci\ufb01cation\nspeci\ufb01es\n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2023.

Here the CNF is described in a Resource Catalog by specifications, as \ndepicted in Figure 3, where a distributed AMF is implemented as a Kubernetes StatefulSet (represented \nas SoftwareSpecification) containing Pods (also represented as SoftwareSpecification). An AMF node \n(represented as ResourceFunction) implements interface connection points (represented as \nAPISpecification) for internal RPC and external N2 (and normally many others).  \nFigure 4 depicts the Function of an example distributed AMF instance, described in a Resource Inventory. \nThe distributed AMF instance (represented as composite ResourceFunction) includes a connectionPoint \nattribute referencing the N2 interfaces (represented as API) while the connectivity attribute may contain a \ntopology graph describing the internal nodes (represented as atomic ResourceFunction) connected \nthrough the RPC interfaces (represented as API).  \n \n \nFigure 3: 5GC AMF Specification \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4: Distributed AMF \n    \n \n \nRPC \n(ApiSpeci\ufb01cation)\nN2 \n(ApiSpeci\ufb01cation)\nAMF Node \n(ResourceFunctionSpeci\ufb01cation)\nAMF Container \n(SoftwareSpeci\ufb01cation)\nAMF Pod \n(SoftwareSpeci\ufb01cation)\nAMF StatefulSet \n(SoftwareSpeci\ufb01cation)\n5G Core AMF \n(ResourceFunction)\nN2 \n(API)\nNode A \n(ResourceFunction)\nRPC \n(API)\nN2 \n(API)\nNode B \n(ResourceFunction)\nRPC \n(API)\nN2 \n(API)\nNode C \n(ResourceFunction)\nRPC \n(API)\n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2023.

For example, within a \nlist of ResourceSpecification instances some may be instances of SoftwareSpecification, \nResourceFunctionSpecification, APISpecification, HostingRequirementSpecification and \nSoftwareSupportPackageSpecification.

The period of time for which a characteristic is \napplicable. \nResourceSpecificationCharacteristicRelationship sub-resource \nAn aggregation, migration, substitution, dependency or exclusivity relationship between/among \nResourceSpecificationCharacteristics. The specification characteristic is embedded within the \nspecification whose ID and href are in this entity, and identified by its ID. \n@baseType \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the super-class. \n@schemaLocation \nAn uri (Uri). A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional \nattributes and relationships. \n@type \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the sub-class Extensible name. \ncharacteristicSpecificationId A string. Unique identifier of the characteristic within the specification. \nname \nA string. Name of the target characteristic within the specification. \nrelationshipType \nA string. Type of relationship such as aggregation, migration, substitution, \ndependency, exclusivity. \nresourceSpecificationHref \nAn uri (Uri).

When sub-classing, this defines the super-class. \n@schemaLocation \nAn uri (Uri). A URI to a JSON-Schema file that defines additional attributes and \nrelationships. \n@type \nA string. When sub-classing, this defines the sub-class Extensible name. \ncharacteristic \nA list of resource specification characteristics \n(ResourceSpecificationCharacteristic [*]). A characteristic that refines the \nrelationship. For example, consider the relationship between a slot and a card. \nFor a half-height card it is important to know the position at which the card is \ninserted, so a characteristic Position might be defined on the relationship to \nallow capturing of this in the inventory. \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2023.

Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if \nit does not support multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint \ncan be created again. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null} \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2023.
