A service usage is an occurrence of usage on a \nService derived from various Resource usages, which can be further used by BSS for determining the Product usage. \nIt is comprised of characteristics, which represent attributes of service usage. \nThe ServiceUsage API performs the following operations on the ServiceUsage resource: \n- \nRetrieval of a ServiceUsage or a collection of ServiceUsage, depending on filter criteria \n- \nPartial update of a ServiceUsage or of a collection of ServiceUsage \n- \nCreation of a ServiceUsage \nThe ServiceUsageSpecification API provides a standardized mechanism for service usage specification management \nsuch as the creation, update, retrieval of a service usage specification. Service Usage Specification defines the \ndetailed description of a service usage event that are of interest to the business. It is comprised of characteristics, \nwhich define all attributes known for a particular type of usage.  \nThe ServiceUsageSpecification API perform the following operations on the ServiceUsageSpecification resource: \n- \nRetrieval of a ServiceUsageSpecification or a collection of ServiceUsageSpecification, depending on filter \ncriteria \n- \nPartial update of a ServiceUsageSpecification or of a collection of ServiceUsageSpecification \n- \nCreation of a ServiceUsageSpecification"}

Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base \nentities, for instance a TypeAServiceUsage or TypeBServiceUsage inheriting properties from the base ServiceUsage \nentity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v4.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nServiceUsage instances some may be instances of TypeAServiceUsage and some of TypeBServiceUsage. The @type \ngives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided \nwhen this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a RelatedParty object) to explicitly \ndenote the actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes \nthe class type of the reference itself, such as RelatedParty, and not the class type of the referred object. However \nsince reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n \n \n\n\nRESOURCE MODEL \nManaged Entity and Task Resource Models \nService Usage resource \nAn occurrence of usage on a Service derived from various resource usages.
