This is done through definition of each area of business activity, in the form of process \ncomponents or Process Elements that can be decomposed to expose progressive detail. These process elements can then be positioned within a model to\nshow organizational, functional and other relationships, and can be combined within process flows that trace activity paths through the business. \nThe eTOM framework can serve as the blueprint for standardizing and categorizing business activities (or process elements) that will help set direction and\nthe starting point for development and integration of Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS and OSS respectively). An important additional \napplication for the eTOM framework is that it helps to support and guide work by TM Forum members and others to develop their solutions. It provides an \nindustry-standard reference point, when considering internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working agreements with \nother enterprises, and for suppliers into such enterprises, the eTOM framework outlines potential boundaries of process solutions, and the required \nfunctions, inputs, and outputs that must be supported by process solutions. \n \n Introduction \nThis document contains the main text of eTOM for this domain. It is comprised of decompositions and descriptions of the process elements that make out \nthis domain. \nThe focus of the Business Process Framework is on the business processes used by service providers, the linkages between these processes, and the use of Marke\nProduct, Customer, Service, Resource, Business Partner, and Enterprise Management related information by multiple processes. \n\n\np\np\np\ny\np\nq\nthat occurs. Thereby this Core Process includes all of the information regarding the activity. Lower level processes also known as Task Processes are then\ndescribing a unique path of action and further detail the specific process. This is then repeated to lower level of granularly of up to seven levees.  \nAt the start of each Level 2 process a diagram details all of its sub processes is placed. This diagram showers Level 3 process and the level 4 process \nbelow them in  boxes where the same level boxes are side by side and the their child processes in side each box. Process that have further decomposition\ninclude another box in box diagram of level 5, 6 and 7 process if existing.   \nProcess Associations and IDs \nTo aid understanding and navigation, each process described here has an associated indication. \nProcesses have been given a process ID throughout this document. The format of the numbering scheme work as follows: \n.b.x.c.d.e where  \n \nb: \nThis digit is used to identify the originator of the process It is set to 1 if the process is the TMF original one, to 2 otherwise so if a company chooses \nto  \nextended the Business Process Framework it can do so keeping the original numbering and extend as needed.   \nx: \nDigit representing Domain  \nc: \nDigit representing Level 2 process \nd: \nDigit representing Level 4 process \ne: \nDigit representing Level 5 process \nThe unique identifier thus associated with individual processes can thus be used to assist in locating individual processes. \n\n\nTypographic Conventions \n \n\u00b7  A Business Process is represented by a decorator in form of an arrow located to the top right. A red dot decorator with the initial TMF indicates that \nthis is a TM Forum Business Process. The color yellow background hints to the business  layer. \n \n \n \n\n\n Glossary \nName \nDescription \nABE \nAggregate Business Entity \nBE \nBusiness Entity \neTOM \nenhanced Telecom Operation Map (TMF Framework) \nODA \nOpen Digital Architecture \nSID \nShared Information Data model (TMF Framework) is the previous name of Information \nFramework \nTAM \nTelecom Applications Map (TMF Framework) is the previous name of Application \nFramework \n \n \n\n\n Enterprise Domain \n \nStrategic Management \nProcess Identifier: 1.7.1 \nHierarchy Level: 2 \nBrief Description: \nStrategic Management business process directs and controls the development of strategy and plans of the organization as a whole. \nExtended Description: \nStrategic Management business process directs and controls the development of strategy and plans of the organization as a whole.  \n \nEnterprise Domain Main Diagram \n1.7.9-  Business Assurance\nFramework Management\ntmf\n1.7.18- Corporate Finance\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.12- Enterprise Asset\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.14- Enterprise\nGovernance Management\ntmf\n1.7.13- Enterprise\nPerformance Management\ntmf\n1.7.7- Human Resources\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.15-\nLearning\u00a0Management\ntmf\n1.7.1- Strategic Management\ntmf\n1.7.10- Supply Chain\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.16-\nTraining\u00a0Management\ntmf\n1.7.5- Financial\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.4- Knowledge\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.2- Enterprise Risk\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.11- Enterprise Security\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.19- Enterprise Audit\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.20- Enterprise Privacy\nManagement\ntmf\n1.7.21- Enterprise\nInformation Management\ntmf\n1.7.17- Research\nManagement\ntmf"}

This includes \nseveral key components: \n \n1. Identification of the need for a tool or solution.  This will include the creation of business case materials needed to support the need for investment in \ntechnology to replace manual operations or enhance volumes of data being analyzed, etc.  This process will also be the origination point for requirements \nvetting, collecting, and aggregation into RFx issuance, and the subsequent review and scoring of responses received. \n2. Deployment scope and project management of any tool or solution.  While the operator often contains an internal PMO for deployment \nactivities/oversight, actual requirements needed by the Fraud program must be represented and ensured by the policy process.  \n3. Staff preparation.  Use of technology requires training in both the use of the technology and the fraud domain itself to understand rules and processes \nbeing employed by tools.  The policy process must identify and maintain the necessary staff requirements to operate tools to the full extent of their deploye\ncapabilities. \n4. Ongoing process and rule enhancement.  Tools are subject to modifications and enhancements necessary to address constant changes within the fraud\nenvironment.  The policy process must maintain guidelines on when rules and processes may be enhanced or updated. \n5. Access to fraud tools and systems.  Tools within the fraud environment have access to particularly sensitive information that require increased levels of \nsecurity.  Policies must be in place to determine who is allowed access to these tools, and specifically, what actions they are allowed to perform within \nthese fraud tools.  For example, configuration of rules for detection should be performed by appropriate staff to ensure fair yet thorough application of any \n\n\np\np\np\ng\ng ,\npp\ny\np\nthe needs for growth, requirements for enhancements must be maintained within the policy process, and made available to tool developers and/or to \nsubsequent RFx issuing.

Not only is this information constantly growing \ninternally within any given operator, but the available information externally is growing even more rapidly (other operators, industry standards and bodies, \nLEAs, etc.).  Management of this information is critical to the success and efficiency of any fraud protection program. \n \nInternal management tasks: \n1.

Considering the number of operators globally \ntoday, there is a vast amount of information around fraud types, methods, detection practices, etc., that (if available between operators) could save \nconsiderable time, money, and effort within any given operator.  However, policies do need to be in place to guard against the sharing of sensitive \ninformation that could, in fact, harm the sharing operator.

One of the key factors relates to the experience and conduct of the internal staff.  Certain \nactions by internal staff could result in harm to the operator in terms of financial loss, loss of customers, or loss of sensitive internal information.  Policies \nneed to be constructed and maintained within the operator that outline the conduct that is expected of employees, and also what is considered a breach, o\nviolation, of that conduct.

Rule Processing:  During rule processing activities, information and data is passed through rules either through automated (technology-based) means or\nother manual processes.  Depending on the volume of data and the complexity of the rules (interdependencies, aggregated or weighted triggering, etc.), \nincreasing levels of technology will be necessary to quickly implement rules against data and determine the results. \n2. Alert Generation:  Configuration of alerts.  Alerts may be generated when certain expected conditions are not met, including missing dataset delivery, \nfailure to act on investigation requests (escalations), etc.  Alerts may also be issued when certain conditions are exceeded, including excessive alarm \nquantities resulting from \u201cloose\u201d rules producing false positive results. \n3. Alarm Generation:  Configuration of alarms.  Alarms are typically the result of detected events or activities that are suspicious and should be investigated\nas possible fraud.  Alarms may be the result of single rule violations, or of multiple rule violations that contribute to weighted levels of suspicion (more \ncomplex scenario) etc. \n \nOther functions may also include the configuration of supplementary reports for scenarios not configured through rules and alarms as listed above. \n \nThe configuration of rules, alerts, and alarms should be governed by policies as described in the 1.1.x processes for Fraud Management.  Additionally, the \nprocedures that should be followed as a result of the issuance of an alert or alarm should be governed by policies as described within the 1.1.x processes \nfor Fraud Management. \n \n Analyze Fraud \nProcess Identifier: 1.7.9.2.2.2 \nHierarchy Level: 5 \nBrief Description: \nThis process is the ongoing activity of investigating, diagnosing, and implementing controls to both prevent fraud and minimize existing fraud impacts. \nExtended Description:\n\n\ny\np\np\ng\ny\ny\np\np\nlinear flow that also includes feedback into action and support processes, as described below. \n \n1. Alarm Assessment:  As data processing triggers alarms of suspected fraud, the assessment activity is the first point at which initial triage of the alarm(s) \nis conducted.   During the assessment, the analyst should determine, based on business rules, the initial validity of the alarm, a priority of the alarm (based\non value, affected systems, or other criteria), and the appropriate team that would need to address the alarm (e.g., billing, wholesale partner, network, etc.)\n2. Alarm Investigation:  Once initial assessment has occurred, the alarm is then forwarded to an investigation activity that typically begins as an internal \nfunction.   During investigation additional data may be accessed, scope of the issue may be ascertained, and an overall understanding of the issue will \nneed to be achieved before determining whether the issue is, in fact, fraud.  During this process initial actions may be invoked (e.g., disrupted service) to \nprevent further loss/risk prior to customer contact and/or fraud determination work. \n3. Contact Customer:  Once internal investigations have gathered all information available, a customer contact may be necessary to understand customer \nintention, validity of the subscriber, etc.  This is the final process performed prior to reaching a fraud decision.  If no customer is directly involved, this step \nmay not be necessary (e.g., Dealer Fraud, Internal Fraud). \n4. Fraud Determination:  Once all information is collected from internal and external investigations, a fraud determination is made.  If the decision is that the\nissue is not fraud, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Fraud Actions process (1.2.3) for closure, and the Support process \n(1.3.3) for enhancement of rules and configurations to possibly avoid recurrence of this alarm condition.  If the decision is that the issue is, in fact fraud, \nsimilar subsequent activities will occur:  First, the issue is referred to the Fraud Actions (1.2.3) process to properly handle actions to stop the fraud, initiate \ncollections and legal actions, etc.  Second, all investigative materials and findings are then passed onto the Support process (1.3.3) for enhancement of \nrules and configurations to hotlists, blacklists, and any refinement needed to possibly capture the issue more rapidly. \n5. Recording and Reporting:  After the determination is made as fraud or not fraud, activities associated with the analysis are finally passed into recording o\nactions, and reporting of recoveries, time to capture and correct, and preventative actions now in process. \n \n Perform Fraud Actions \nProcess Identifier: 1.7.9.2.2.3 \nHierarchy Level: 5"}

Each sub process is capable of being a stand-alone process (not dependent on other Actions sub processes), however more than one of \nthese Actions may be used to help bring any given issue to appropriate closure. \n \n1. No Action:  If an issue is determined to not be fraud, the issue is closed and archived as part of this process.  Concurrent flows to Support and Reporting\nhave also occurred to adjust rules, etc., as a result.  No further action is required.  Note:  A feedback to the System Configuration Management process \nshould be considered in this case, for possible alarm threshold adjustment, whitelist updates, etc.  This process path is denoted in Figure 5:  \u201cOverall \nProcess\u201d. \n2. Adjust Customer Billing:  Certain fraud instances result in customers being the victim in addition to the operator.  In these cases, extent of customer \ndamage needs to be quickly ascertained and corrected in the customer\u2019s billing and/or services.  While the determination of the damage is typically \nperformed by the fraud team, the actual Customer Billing corrective action is usually performed by a Customer Care Team, based on information forwarded\nby the Fraud Team. \n3. Legal or LEA (Law Enforcement Agency) Action:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and significant financial loss, contract breach, or other illegal \nactivities have occurred, the operator may seek recourse via the legal system.  This may be via civil reparations and/or criminal charges.  This sub process\nwill utilize the operator\u2019s policies (1.1.5) to determine whether attorney, law enforcement, or other assistance is needed.  This sub process will also use the\nsame policies to determine and collect supporting information that will be necessary for those external agencies to properly pursue their activities. \n4. Terminate Customer:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and the operator deems the issue to be of enough magnitude to warrant termination, this \nprocess will conduct the termination of the customer (e.g., initiate the disconnect order). \n5. Dismiss Staff:  If an issue is determined to be fraud and/or a substantial violation of internal operator policies and internal staff have been found \nresponsible, termination of the staff may be initiated at this step.  Fraud team findings for ethics policy violations, fraud investigative results, etc., should be\nforwarded to Human Resources, where appropriate actions will be initiated.  Of important note:  Staff negligence resulting in fraud is sometimes \ninappropriately diagnosed as intentional when, in fact, accidental actions may have exposed the operator to the fraud.  Care should be taken to fully \n\n\ng\n,\np\np\ny\np\ng\nenhancements.  Business process may have, in fact, allowed the fraud to occur, therefore the first step in prevention should happen well before a rule \nshould capture the condition.
