It includes the model \ndefinition as well as all available operations. Possible actions are creating, updating and retrieving customer quotes.  \nThe customer Quote API provides a standardized mechanism for placing a customer quote with all of the necessary \nquote parameters. The API consists of a simple set of operations that interact with CRM/Order Negotiation systems \nin a consistent manner. A customer quote is created based on a product offer that is defined in a catalog. The quote \nidentifies the product or set of products that are available to a customer, and includes characteristics such as pricing \n(eventually special pricing for the customer described in the quote), product options and agreement.  \nQuote API performs the following operations on customer quote: \n- \nRetrieval of a customer quote or a collection of customer quote depending on filter criteria \n- \nPartial update of a customer quote (including updating rules) \n- \nCreation of a customer quote (including versioning, default values and creation rules) \n- \nDeletion of customer quote (for administration purposes) \n- \nNotification of events on quote \no Quote creation \no Quote removal \no Quote state change \no Quote value change used to notify that any data in an quote has just changed \no Quote information required used to notify that some data in the quote need to be filled / are missing \no Quote is a pending state waiting approval (for the whole quote or only for quote item) \no quote is accepted by the customer but there is a least one agreement to be signed \n \nThe following Assumptions were considered in the development of this document: \n- \nThe customer quote management system has access to the commercial catalog system.  \n- \nSupplier Quote is not managed in the scope of this document"}

All Rights Reserved\nPage 7 sur 74\nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, \nfor instance a PricingRequest and Quoting inheriting properties from the Quote entity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of Quote \ninstances some may be instances of PricingRequest where other could be instances of Quoting. The @type gives this \ninformation. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be provided when this is \nuseful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a QuoteRef object) to explicitly denote \nthe actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class \ntype of the reference itself, such as PricingRequestRef or QuotingRef, and not the class type of the referred object. \nHowever since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2019.

The same quote may exist but with different version numbers.  \nIt may be possible for a sale administrator to see all the existing versions or for a partner to see only a subset of all \nthe existing versions.  \nThe entity version number is not dependent on the version number of the API.  \nIn order to distinguish resources representing entities running with different version numbers and accessible \nthough the same API version, the following directive can be used /id:(version=x) and the version attribute is added \nto each entity. \n \n{ \n    \"id\": \"12dd-78hg\", \n    \"href\": \"https://host:port/quoteManagement/v4/quote/12dd-78hg\", \n    \"category\": \"BSBS Quote\", \n    \"description\": \"Quote illustration\", \n    \"effectiveQuoteCompletionDate\": \"2019-05-013T12:45:12.028Z\", \n    \"expectedFulfillmentStartDate\": \"2019-05-21T12:45:12.028Z\", \n    \"expectedQuoteCompletionDate\": \"2019-05-14T12:45:12.028Z\", \n    \"externalId\": \"QO-tr-89\", \n    \"instantSyncQuote\": false, \n    \"quoteDate\": \"2019-05-06T12:45:12.028Z\", \n    \"requestedQuoteCompletionDate\": \"2019-05-14T12:45:12.028Z\", \n    \"version\": \"1\", \n    \"agreement\": [ \n        { \n            \"id\": \"7778-jj56\", \n            \"href\": \"https://host:port/agreementManagement/v4/agreement/7778-jj56\", \n            \"name\": \"Global Agrrement\", \n            \"@baseType\": \"Agreement\", \n            \"@referredType\": \"MassAgreement\" \n        } \n    ], \n    \u2026. \n \nNote that the quote resources in this case may have the same ID but may be distinguished by the inclusion of the \nversion number in their ID i.e. /Quote: 12dd-78hg (version=1.0), /Quote: 12dd-78hg (version=2.0). \nIn the following examples, we will assume that two versions of the Quote exist.
