The structure of the document consists of four main \nsections: Concepts, Principles, Frameworks (Models) and Methods. \nKey concepts defined and described here provide the general ideas formalizing the \nOpen Digital Architecture (ODA). The principles established can help manage an \norganization's enterprise architecture, with architectural assets such as the Business \nProcess Framework (eTOM), Information Framework (SID), Functional Framework \n(FF) and Metrics etc.  These assets are pivotal to manage and operationalize the \nenterprise. Methods break down of the complex running of an enterprise into best \npractices, while the Models provide relational representation of the core business \nblocks. Altogether, the Framework provides the supporting \"beams\" to enable an \norganization to function according to an enterprise architecture blueprint, \nThis document can be used as a business analysis tool with variations applied to \ndifferent businesses (e.g. Service Provider). It can also be helpful when clarifying \nconcepts to organize ideas. By leveraging a solid framework, as described in this \ndocument, the reader is able to capture \"realistically\" core business concepts of an \norganization and do this in a way that is tried and proven."}

The \nfoundational CONTEXTS are used to establish the enterprise's building blocks. These \nbuilding blocks are fundamental to the Open Digital Framework (ODF) as they define \nkey concepts that are used throughout ODF. The core frameworks that make up the \nTM Forum ODF, include the Business Process Framework (aka eTOM), the \nInformation Framework (aka as SID), and the Functional Framework (derived from the \nprevious TAM). \nThe key principles provide the rules and guidelines that govern the application of key \nconcepts in the Open Digital Framework. The rules are designed to reflect the values \nand goals of a digital organization, while providing direction and guidance for decision-\nmaking. These principles help to ensure consistency, alignment, and coherence across \nany architecture that aspires to align with the Open Digital Architecture (ODA).  \nThe section on method or methodology establish the processes and techniques that \nhelp an enterprise architect leverage the Open Digital Framework. They provide a \nstructured and systematic approach to identify, analyze, design, and communicate the \narchitecture. These methods or methodologies are here to help ensure quality, \nefficiency, and effectiveness of the target architecture of the organization.  \nModels are the representations and artifacts that help the enterprise architect, design, \ndocument and communicate the architecture. In TM Forum, the Master Open Digital \nArchitecture (MODA) is the definitive reference for ODA which provides the context and \nvisualization of the structure, behavior, and relationships of the ODA business objects \n(architectural elements). Models help to ensure clarity, purpose, completeness and \nconsistency of the architecture as they evolve through a maturation process which \nimproves its reliability for TM Forum members.  \nThe adoption of the TM Forum core frameworks has the benefit of providing alignment \nwith key industry standards and common ontology, in support of the enterprise's \nstrategic and business goals. This can help boost both business and technical \ncapabilities. All principles described in this document provide a foundational ground for \nthe development of the enterprise's governance, rules and policies. \n \n \n \n\n\n1. CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS \n1.1. CONTEXTS \nContexts provide an overarching structure for the frameworks for the classification and \ngrouping of all business objects and architectural artifacts. There are two types of \ncontexts; 1) Horizontal Contexts commonly known as \"Domains\", and 2) Vertical \nContexts. \nNot all domains and vertical contexts are present in each of the frameworks  \n1.1.1. \nHORIZONTAL CONTEXT (DOMAINS) \nHorizontal contexts are commonly known as Domains are of two kinds 1. Business \nDomains (shown in color in the diagram below) and 2. Non-Business Domains. \nThe Business Domains represent areas of operations for delivery and management of \nthe business. \nThe Non-Business Domains represent collections of common objects and technical \nfunctions supporting the business areas. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1-1 Core Frameworks Domains"}

The domain addresses market and sales strategy, \ncapability delivery, lifecycle management and support of parties (e.g. individuals / \norganizations and things ) that move through the stages of selling (e.g., contact / lead / \nprospect). \nMarketing and Sales are two distinct and yet interconnected concepts in an enterprise \nwith Marketing creating awareness, generating leads and building relationships with \nparties in the marketplace, and Sales focused on closing deals and generating \nrevenue.  \n1.1.1.2.  Product Domain \nThe Product domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried out \nby parties (e.g., individuals / organizations and things) playing roles that are involved in \nthe strategic planning, definition, development and operational aspects of Products that \nare conceived and offered for marketing and sales by the Service Provider.   \n1.1.1.3.  Customer Domain \nThe Customer domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried out \nby parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that are involved in the \nmanagement of and all types of contact with customers as they acquire, use, pay for \nand are supported for goods and services (i.e., products) that they obtain from an \nenterprise. Activities include: Strategy to Readiness (e.g., customer strategies, \ncapabilities, customer lifecycle management) and Operations (e.g., customer \nrelationship management , data, privacy, interactions, communications, orders, \naccounts, balances, service level agreements (SLAs), training, problems, cases, \ninvoices, payments, disputes, collections, loyalty, performance, usage statistics, \nanalytics and support). \n1.1.1.4.  Service Domain \nThe Service domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried out \nby parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing  roles that are involved in the \nstrategic planning, definition, development, and operational aspects of Services that \nare used to realize Product offerings to the market. Activities include management of: \nstrategies, capabilities, lifecycles, catalogs, inventories, installations, activations, \nproblems, performance, guiding, mediation, usage statistics and support of customer-\nfacing services that are offered to customers and resource-facing services that are \npresented to resources by an enterprise. \n1.1.1.5.  Resource Domain \nThe Resource domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried out \nby parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that are involved in the \nstrategic planning, definition, development and operational aspects of Resources (e.g., \nfunctions, applications, computing, networking and storage) that represent the \ninfrastructure of an enterprise that are used to realize Services. Activities include \nmanagement of strategies, capabilities, lifecycles, catalogs, inventories, topologies, \ninstallations, activations, alarms, problems, performance, mediation, usage statistics \nand support of Resources that are managed by an enterprise. \n1.1.1.6.  Business Partner Domain \nThe Business Partner domain represents roles, activities, information and functions \ncarried out by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that are involved in \nthe strategic planning, definition, development, operational aspects and all types of \ncontact with Business Partners (e.g., Suppliers, Partners, etc.) with which an enterprise \ncollaborates in order to operate their business. Activities include management of \nBusiness Partner: strategies, capabilities, value propositions, relationships, profiles, \nd t\ni\nit\ni t\nti\ni\nti\nt\nd\nt\nd\n\n\nagreements (SLAs), training, problems, cases, invoices, payments, revenues, disputes, \ncollections, loyalty, performance, usage statistics, analytics and support of Business \nPartners as they supply, acquire, use, support, purchase, pay for and are supported for \ngoods and services (products) that they provide and / or obtain from an enterprise. \n1.1.1.7.  Enterprise Domain \nThe Enterprise domain represents roles, activities, information and functions that are \nrequired to run and support a business. These concepts focus on both the setting and \nachieving of strategic corporate goals and objectives, as well as providing those \nsupport services that are required throughout an Enterprise. These concepts are \nsometimes considered to be the corporate functions and/or processes (e.g., Financial \nManagement, Human Resources Management processes, etc.). Since Enterprise \nManagement is aimed at general support within the Enterprise, they may interface as \nneeded with almost every other process in the Enterprise, be they operational, \nstrategy, infrastructure or product processes. \n1.1.1.8. Shared Domain \nThe Shared domain is a specialized domain that is formalized for use in the Information \nFramework (SID) and the Functional Framework. This special domain represents \ninformation, functions and metrics that are not \u201cowned by\u201d any particular domain and \nare referenced or utilized from two or more other domains.  \n1.1.1.9. Patterns Domain \nThe Pattern domain is a specialized domain that is formalized for use in the Information \nFramework. It contains abstract ABEs not directly usable. These patterns need to be \nsub-classed to be used. \n1.1.1.10. Integration Domain \nThe integration domain represents business-agnostic roles, information and activities \n(e.g., infrastructure, middleware, protocols) that support the integration and \nimplementation of ODF concepts (e.g., business entities, business processes, \nfunctions, logical applications, interfaces, metrics, etc.). \n1.1.2. \nVERTICAL CONTEXT (LIFECYCLE STAGE) \nDevelopment, Implementation and Operation of business entities and business \nartifacts related to the respective horizontal contexts. \n1.1.2.1. Vertical Context Area (Lifecycle Area) \nVertical Context Area provide a classification of vertical contexts mostly relevant to the \nBusiness Process Framework (eTOM) and the Functional Framework; they represent a \nseparation of concerns by dividing the enterprise lifecycle in two parts; 1) Strategy-to-\nReadiness (includes 'Strategy Management', 'Capability Management', 'Business Value \nDevelopment' and a shared part of 'Operations Readiness & Support'), and 2) \nOperations (includes a shared part of 'Operations Readiness & Support', 'Fulfillment', \n'Assurance', and 'Billing'). \n1.1.2.2. Vertical Context Stage (Lifecycle Stage) \nVertical Context Stage provide a classification of vertical contexts as a means to further \ngroup them according to the two parts of the enterprise lifecycle, as described \npreviously."}

(see Figure 1.1).  \nStrategy-to-Readiness\" area identifies the business processes that can help \norganizations prepare for engagement with their markets. It includes transformation \nthat readies people, processes and technology/platforms for operations. \n \nStrategy Management \nThe Strategy Management vertical is a lifecycle stage that focuses on business objects \nthat generate and manage specific business strategies, gain business buy-in, track \neffectiveness of the strategies, and optimize strategy required. \nStrategy Management is focused on the analysis and generation of strategies in \nsupport of all development and operations within the enterprise while establishing \nbusiness commitment within the enterprise. \nCapability Management \nThe Capability Management vertical is a lifecycle stage that focuses on the \ndevelopment and deployment of capabilities including all infrastructures for the delivery \nof products and services as well as support infrastructures and all business enablers. \nFramework artifacts in this vertical grouping identify requirements, design and develop \nnew or enhanced capabilities and monitor their performance to adjust as required. \n \n \n\n\nThe Business Value Development vertical grouping focuses on the definition, planning, \ndesign and implementation of value propositions and business promoting \nconcepts/assets in the enterprise\u2019s business portfolio. \nFrameworks artifacts in this vertical grouping create products, services, resources, \nbusiness partner catalog information, sales and marketing campaigns and material and \nprocess Operations feedback to adjusts as required for Lifecycle management. \nOperations Lifecycle context area  \nThe Operations context area groups the lifecycle context stages: Fulfillment, \nAssurance, Billing, and part of Operations Readiness & Support. \nThe Operations context area includes all the artifacts and building blocks that support \ncustomer operations, as well those that enable direct interactions with the customer. \nSuch artifacts include both day-to-day and operations readiness and support. The \n\u201cFAB\u201d (or \"OFAB\") verticals in Operations are sometimes referred to as Customer \nOperations processes. \n Operations Readiness & Support \nOperations Readiness & Support lifecycle stage is responsible for ensuring operational \nreadiness and support of Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing. \n Fulfillment \nFulfillment lifecycle stage is responsible for initiation, instantiation and fulfillment of \ncustomer requests. \nFrameworks artifacts in this vertical grouping initiate fulfillment actions and convert \nrequests (customer or business) into orders, to be delivered using the value offerings \nfrom the enterprise\u2019s portfolio. This includes creation of instances of relevant artifacts in \nall domains necessary for the delivery of the value offerings. \n Assurance \nThis vertical context is responsible for running operations along with monitoring, \nmeasuring, analyzing and correcting to ensure the best performance, including Quality \nof Service.  Frameworks artifacts in this vertical context perform continuous status and \nperformance monitoring of ongoing operations. They collect performance data and \nanalyze them to identify potential problems and apply preventive and corrective \nmaintenance without impacting the customer. \nThe Assurance activities receive trouble reports and take necessary actions to ensure \ntimely corrections. \nThe Assurance activities ensure that overall performance and quality meets service \nlevel agreements, metric goals (KPIs) as well as reporting. \n Billing \nThis vertical context is responsible for translating business activities into revenue.  \nFramework artifacts in this vertical context perform collection of appropriate usage \nrecords to determine charging and production of timely and accurate bills and supports \npayment of services and operation-related cost accounting. \nThey provide pre-bill usage information and are processing customer payments and \nperforming payment collections. \n \n \n\n\n1.2. BUSINESS CAPABILITY MAP \n(FUTURE WORK) \n1.3. BUSINESS PROCESS FRAMEWORK \nThe Business Process Framework is a reference framework or model for the definition, \nclassification and decomposition of Service Provider business process abstractions. A \nbusiness process abstraction is a generalization of actual context-specific business \nprocesses.  So, rather than describing the process as it exists at company A or \ncompany B, or in one part of an organization versus another, the abstraction describes \nthe essence of the process, and as such it can be used to \"categorize\" any or all of \nthose context-specific processes that match the description. \nFor more than 20 years, the TM Forum has developed the Business Process \nFramework in collaboration with its members, and has achieved industry-wide \nrecognition, from the highest conceptual concepts, to the detailed process \ndecomposition, taking into account real-world experience in the design, implementation \nand management of business processes in a service provider's environment and \noperations. It represents an ontology of business activities without prejudice to specific \nbusiness process models or workflows realized in the context of specific enterprise \nstrategies and market dynamics. \n1.3.1. \nPurpose \nThe purpose of the Business Process Framework is to provide a standard process \nstructure, terminology, and classification scheme for business processes in an \nenterprise. It offers an enterprise-wide discipline for the development of business \nprocesses that assure a consistent and reusable repository of processes in business \nprocess models.  \nAs a framework, it serves as a tool for discussion and agreement between providers \nand consumers which encourage clear definitions, convergence and understanding of: \n\u2022 \nBusiness requirements \n\u2022 \nInformation agreements \n\u2022 \nApplication contracts; and \n\u2022 \nshared data model specifications (exchanges between applications or \nsystems)  \nTM Forum BPF is a cross-industry process view that presents a common ontology for \nequipment suppliers, applications builders and integrators to define, build and operate \nsystems and solution. \n1.3.2. \nScope \nTM Forum Business Process Framework recognizes the different types of business \nprocesses in an enterprise. The scope of the Business Process Framework covers the \nthree broad categorization of an enterprise business processes  - Core, Enabling and \nSupporting (also categorized in other ontologies as Operational, Management and \nSupporting respectively.)"}

Core Process \nCore Process is a business process that constitute the core business and create the \nprimary value stream of an enterprise. They are strategically important to the \nenterprise, and derive from the core competency of the business the enterprise is \ninvolved in -like taking and delivering orders from customers, defining and delivering \nproducts and services etc.   \n1.3.2.2. Enabling Process \nEnabling Process, also known as management processes, is a business process that \nsets direction, like monitoring performance and executing plans for the enterprise.  \n1.3.2.3. Supporting Process  \nSupport process is a business process that services the basic functions of the \norganization, like accounting, technical support, human resource etc.  \n1.3.3. \nConceptual View \nThe conceptual view below shows the decomposition structure for a business process, \nfrom the top level to lower levels. At the highest level of representation is the \"Business \nProcess\". The decomposition of the \"Business Process\" in directly supporting \n\"Business Activity\" starts at the level 3.     \n \nFigure 1-3 Conceptional organization of TM Forum Business Process \n \n \n\n\n1.3.4.1. Business Process Model (Workflow) \nA business process model is a graphical representation of a business process or \nworkflow and its related sub-processes. It defines the ways in which operations are \ncarried out to accomplish the intended objectives of an organization. Business process \nmodeling is the graphical representation of a company\u2019s business processes or \nworkflows. This is usually done through different graphing methods, such as the \nflowchart, data-flow diagram, etc. \nRefer to Section 4 in this document for more information about the methodologies \nused. See specific examples of Business Process Models in GB921F and GB921E \nwhere examples showcasing specific uses of Business Process Framework ontology to \nestablish business process models that show E2E workflows depicting for \"product \nmanagement\" and \"order management\" etc. \n1.4. INFORMATION FRAMEWORK \nThe Information Framework is an abstract but formal / defined representation of \nbusiness entities including their properties and relationships  that can be performed on \nthem. A business entity is a thing of interest to the business, while its attributes are \nfacts describe the entity. The formal definitions provide a business-oriented perspective \nto the information and data with a relationship between information and data \nrepresenting interests between two business entities, or between a business entity and \nitself.  \nThe TM Forum Information Framework provides an industry reference for \nrepresentation of concepts and the relationships, constraints, rules, and operations to \nspecify information semantics for a chosen domain of discourse. It typically specifies \nrelations between kinds of things but may also include relations with individual things.  \n1.4.1. \nPurpose \nTM Forum Information Framework provides sharable, stable, and organized structure \nof information requirements or knowledge for domain contexts. As a framework, it \nserves the purpose of providing an enterprise with information definitions along with \nunderlying relations between information exchanged by business processes. \nIn combination with the Business Process Framework, the Information Framework \noffers a way to explain \u2018how\u2019 things are intended to fit together to meet a given \nbusiness need.   \n1.4.2. \nScope \nThe scope of the TM Forum Information Framework is to: \n\u2022 \nEstablish an enterprises approach to Information management and \ngovernance. This includes the aggregating closely related business entities, \nand governing the relationships between business entities.   \n\u2022 \nDescribe the holistic approach to managing information \ncreated/read/updated/deleted by business processes through roles and metrics \nto transform information into business asset \n\u2022 \nStandardize the grouping of business entities into Aggregate Business Entities \n\u2022 \nFormalize Relationship between Business Entities \n\n\ny\ny\nbusiness entities \n \n1.4.2.1. Aggregate Business Entity \nAn Aggregate Business Entity (ABE) is a well-defined set of information and operations \nthat characterize a highly cohesive, loosely coupled set of business entities.  \nIn information modeling, an ABE is a way to further partition DOMAIN by grouping related \nBusiness Entities  (BEs) together. ABE can contain other ABE  or BE and can be \nconsidered as sub-domains. A given domain can contain anything from a few to over \n15 ABEs. \n1.4.2.2. Business Entity \nA Business Entity represents something of interest to the business that may be \ntangible things (such as a Customer), active things (such as a Customer Order), or \nconceptual things (such as a Customer Account).  Business entities are characterized \nby attributes and participate in relationships with other business entities. Business \nentity instances typically move through a well-defined life cycle.  \n1.4.2.3. Attribute \nAn attribute is a fact that describes a business entity. \n1.4.2.4. Relationship \nA relationship is an association of business interest between two business entities, or \nbetween a business entity and itself. \n \n1.4.3. \nConceptual view  \nAt the highest level, the Information Framework is structured according to the ODA \nhorizontal contexts (aka domains). Within each domain there is a high degree of \ncohesion.  Within each domain there is a high degree of cohesion between the \nidentified business entities, and loose coupling between different domains. This \nenables segmentation of the total business problem and allows resources to be \nfocused on a particular domain of interest. It is envisioned that the use of the resultant \nbusiness entity definitions within each domain, when used in conjunction with the \nBusiness Process Framework, will provide a business view of the shared information. \nWithin each domain, further partitioning of the information is achieved through the \nidentification of Aggregate Business Entities (ABE\u2019s). \n \n \nFigure 1-4 Conceptual organization of  Information Framework Framework"}

This includes the non-business technical aspects. \n1.5.2.1. Functions \n \nA function is a defined set of action(s) that a system is able to do in support of business \nor technical needs.  A function is defined as cohesive around a focused \npurpose.  Functions are typically characterized by action-oriented features, and often \nfocus on elements of information.  Functions are implementation-agnostic (identifying \nwhat systems do as opposed to how). \n1.5.2.2. Aggregate Functions \nAn aggregate function is a cohesive grouping of functions.  The description of each \naggregate function should make clear on what basis functions are grouped together \nwithin that aggregate function, and should provide sufficient basis to determine whether \na given function would belong within or outside of that Aggregate Function. \n \n \n\n\nAggregate Function Level 1 \nAggregate Functions Level 1 contain Aggregate Functions Level 2 or functions. \nAggregate Function Level 2 \nAggregate Functions Level 2 contain Functions. \n1.5.3. \nConceptual view  \n \n \n \nFigure 1-5 Conceptual organization  of Functional Framework  \n1.6.

Because the Business Process Framework is a \ndecomposition model, the lower  \nlevels of the decomposition can be traced back to the higher levels. \nAs a classification or taxonomy of Process Elements, at Level 0 the \nelements are classified into S2R (Strategy to Operations) and \nOperations.

As a general rule, each \nposition is determined by the intersection between the vertical \ngrouping and the horizontal domain to which the process belongs in \nthe process framework. In general, L2 process belong to one unique \nvertical and one unique horizontal domain; however, there are some \nexceptions in which some L2 processes can span more than one \nvertical, these are commonly referred to as cross-functional or \ntransversal core processes. \nRationale \nThe Business Process Framework was created and evolved from two \ndifferent but complementary models: 1) An Enterprise Architecture \nlayering model (based on a construct of hierarchical architecture \nlayers) which originated with the early concepts underpinning the TMN \nmodel; and 2) An enterprise lifecycle structure consisting of vertical \ngroupings (aka lifecycle stages) which originated in the early concepts \nassociated with the FCAPS model. Such design resulted in a matrix of \nX and Y positions, each position characterized by a specific couple \n\u2018vertical/horizontal\u2019, representing a unique stage in the enterprise \nlifecycle and a unique horizontal architecture domain; as a general \nrule, each position hosts several L2 processes, therefore, each L2 \nprocess belongs to one unique vertical and one unique horizontal \ndomain; however, some L2 processes span more than one vertical, \nthese are referred to as cross-functional or transversal processes, they \nare considered exceptions to the previous rule, and therefore they are \nprone to change in the future as the framework continues to evolve. \nImplications Level-2 (L2) processes play a vital role in the lifecycle of the \nenterprise, each L2 process represents a grouping of activities and \ntasks that deliver the intended business outcomes for each part of the \nenterprise process framework, as such, L2 processes are designed \nb\nd\nh\nl\nh\nf\nd\nh\nd li\nb\nh\nf\n\n\nwhich are determined by the position of the process in the framework \ni.e. vertical grouping(s) and horizontal domain to which the process \nbelongs. In the past, common process models were designed \ncontextless\u2013that is\u2013core processes were monolithic elements \ndecomposed into smaller granularity elements, but without being \ndirectly related or mapped to any specific context i.e., didn\u2019t belong to \nany particular enterprise lifecycle or architecture domain e.g., Product, \nService, Resource, etc. The Business Process Framework (eTOM) \nbrought along an innovative classification and modelling of the \nbusiness processes across the enterprise, by adding horizontal \ndomains and vertical Lifecycle stages which provided a meaningful \narchitectural context. \n \nBPF-09 \nBusiness Processes lead on architecture requirements \nStatement \nBusiness processes represent an implementation of the business \nrequirements sourced from the organization\u2019s strategy and business \nintent, as such, business processes embody the required support and \nfull alignment with the business to ensure business operations and \ntheir goals are achieved. \nRationale \nBusiness processes embody the activities and tasks that need to be in \nplace, to enable and support successfully the operation of the \nenterprise, business processes are in alignment with the goals of the \nbusiness, as such, they translate business intent and required \nbusiness capabilities into \u201cimplied\u201d functional requirements that are \nfurther communicated to the functional, application and technology \narchitectures\u2013as subordinates of the Business Architecture\u2013for \nimplementation and execution through either manual or automated \nsupport, or a combination of both. \nImplications Business processes play a central role in the business architecture, as \nthey define altogether the fabric of activities and tasks that are needed \nto effectively support and run the business. It is a vital principle to \nalways ensure an optimal alignment between the enterprise business \ngoals, and the capabilities available to support and achieve those \ngoals. \n2.2.3. \nInformation Framework (Kevin/Cecile- September 7) \n#INF-01 \nCoupling of ABEs to Business Processes \nStatement \nAn ABE shall be created by one business process (denoted primary \nprocess). \nIf a one-to-one coupling is not achievable, an ABE shall be coupled to \nassociated \ncore processes with clear separation of accountability for information \nlifecycle management. \nRationale \nA single primary process should manage the complete life cycle of an \nABE, creating, updating, and deleting entity instances contained within \nthe ABE."}

It is a hierarchical classification scheme with \ndescriptions of the key business processes required to run a service-focused business. \nIt is also a comprehensive, industry-agreed, multi-layered view of the key business \nprocesses required to run an efficient and agile digital enterprise. It provides a common \nlanguage for use across departments, systems, partners and suppliers, reducing cost \nand risk of system implementation, integration and procurement. \nThe eTOM's business-oriented view of the enterprise is useful for planners, managers, \nstrategists and others who need to view the enterprise in business terms, without \nimmediate concern for the nature of the way that these business needs are organized \nor automated within the business. Therefore, eTOM emphasizes issues such as \nprocess structure, process components, process interactivity and the business roles \nand responsibilities to which these relate. \nThe Business Process Framework (eTOM) is a reference framework for categorizing \nall the business activities that a service provider will use in a structured manner that \nallows these to be addressed at various levels of detail. The processes are grouped by \ndomains and vertical category context and are decomposed starting from high level \ncore, supporting and enabling processes that depict key activities succeeded by lower \nlevel unique task activities. \neTOM serves as the blueprint for process direction and provides a reference point for \ninternal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general working \nagreements with other enterprises. \n\n\n \nFigure 3-1: The Level 2 map of the currently published Business Process Framework \n(Please refer to tmforum.org/moda for an up-to-date view)    \n\n\n3.2. Information Framework \nThe Information Framework (also known as the SID) provides an information/data \nreference model and a common information/data vocabulary from a business entity \nperspective.  This 'business view' model uses the concepts of domains and aggregate \nbusiness entities to categorize business entities, reducing duplication and overlap. \nBased on data affinity concepts, the categorization scheme is necessarily layered, with \neach layer identifying in more detail the \u201cthings\u201d associated with the immediate parent \nlayer.  \nThe Information Framework's business-oriented view of the enterprise is useful for \nsoftware engineers, data modelers, enterprise architects as well as business architects \nand strategists due to the fact that an information model identifies the key data entities \nin business terms, serving as a bridge between the business and technical areas of a \nbusiness. \n \nFigure 3-2: The currently published High Level Information Framework (Please refer to \ntmforum.org/moda for an up-to-date view)"}

Functional Framework \nThe Functional Framework is a collection of Functions described as automated \n(computerized) activities, provided for human/machine usage through User Interfaces \nor machine usage through Integration Services.  \nThe Functional Framework Function is defined to produce one specified result. The \nambition is that Functional Framework Functions are defined at such granularity level \nthat when activated the resulting outcome will be completely accepted. For Functions \nwith a description listing more than one sub-function all sub-functions are expected to \nbe performed at every activation. \nThe granularity level shall also allow only one Function in the Functional Framework for \neach described functionality. See the figure below for the current high level map of the \nFunctional Framework Functions.  \n\n\n \n \nFigure 3-3: The Level 1 map of the currently published Functional Framework (Please \nrefer to tmforum.org/moda for an up-to-date view) \n \n \n\n\n4. METHODOLOGY \nThis section outlines methodologies for using the frameworks. While the framework \nprovides a singular and definitive structure with rules, concepts and principles \nto plan or decide assets for the enterprise's information systems, methodologies for \nmodelling target systems and solutions vary and thus this section will highlight relevant \nmethodologies that the frameworks support.  \n4.1. Business Process Modelling methodology  \nBusiness Process Modelling (BPM) is a technique to represent, analyze and improve \nthe activities and workflows of an organization. It helps to identify the goals, inputs, \noutputs, roles, resources, rules and interactions of each process (including activity and \ntasks). \nBy creating a visual and formal representation of the business processes, modelling \nenables a better understanding of the current state and the potential for improvement. \nModelling also facilitates communication and collaboration amongst the stakeholders, \nsuch as managers, employees, customers, suppliers and partners (in an ecosystem \nmanagement play). \nBenefits BPM is that it can support the automation, adaptation and governance of the \nbusiness processes. Automation will use software and/or hardware to perform tasks \nthat would otherwise require human intervention. Automation can increase efficiency, \naccuracy and consistency of the processes, as well as reduce costs and errors. \nAdaptation refers to the ability to change or modify the business process models in \nresponse to changing needs, demands or opportunities. Adaptation can enhance \nflexibility, agility and innovation of the organization, as well as enable it respond to/or \nlead markets. Governance refers to the establishment and enforcement of standards, \npolicies and rules that guide the execution and evaluation of the processes. \nGovernance can ensure quality, compliance and accountability of the organization. \nTo achieve these benefits, business process modelling leverage standardized catalog \nof processes, activities and tasks very well scoped, named, defined/described and \nattributed to their goals. To realize these benefits in practice, BPMs require the use of \nstandards that define the syntax, semantics and notation of the business process \nmodels. Standards are important because they enable interoperability, compatibility \nand integration amongst different entities, tools, systems and platforms that support the \nmodelling, execution and monitoring of business processes. Standards also require \nand ensure consistency, clarity and completeness of the models, as well as facilitate \ntheir validation, verification and testing. Some examples of standards for BPMs are \nBusiness Process Model and Notation (BPMN), Business Process Execution \nLanguage (BPEL) and Unified Modeling Language (UML).  \n\u2022 \nBusiness Process Modeling Notation (BPMN): This is the most widely used \nand accepted standard for BPM. It uses a set of graphical elements to depict \nevents, activities, gateways, flows, pools and lanes in a process diagram. \nBPMN can capture complex and dynamic processes with multiple participants, \nroles and scenarios. BPMN also supports the execution of process models \nusing Business Process Management Systems (BPMS).   \n\n\n \nFigure 3-1 Example of BPMN (reference source:  BPMN 2.0 Business Process \nToolbox Pages | Enterprise Architect User Guide (sparxsystems.com)) \n \n\u2022 \nUnified Modeling Language (UML): This is a general-purpose modeling \nlanguage that can be used for various domains, including software engineering, \nsystems engineering and business analysis. UML offers 14 types of diagrams \nto model different aspects of a system or process, such as use case diagrams, \nactivity diagrams, sequence diagrams and state machine diagrams. UML is \nmore suitable for modeling the detailed logic and behavior of a process, rather \nthan the overall flow and structure. UML also requires more technical \nknowledge and skills to use effectively.   \n\u2022 \nFlowchart: This is a simple and intuitive way to model a process using basic \nshapes and arrows to show the steps and decisions in a workflow. Flowcharts \nare easy to create and understand, but they have limitations in expressing \ncomplex and parallel processes, as well as roles and responsibilities of different \nactors. Flowcharts are also not standardized, which means they can vary in \nstyle and meaning across different contexts and tools.  \nOther models are:  \n\u2022 \nEvent-driven Process Chain (EPC): This is a BPM methodology that uses \nevents, functions, connectors, roles and information objects to model a process. \nEPC focuses on the triggers and outcomes of each process step, rather than \nthe activities themselves. EPC is often used in conjunction with SAP software to \ndesign and implement enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. \n\u2022 \nLifecycle Modeling Language (LML): This is a BPM methodology that uses \nsix core elements to model a process: stakeholders, value propositions, \nactions, measures, decisions and loops. LML emphasizes the value creation \nand delivery aspects of a process, as well as the feedback loops that enable"}

S-BPM views each process participant as an autonomous subject that \ncommunicates with other subjects through messages. S-BPM allows for \ndistributed and dynamic process execution, as well as adaptive and agile \nprocess design. \n \nTM Forum's BPF provides the standards for identifying the composition of business \nprocesses, a common library of tasks and activities performed with objectives that \ndovetail the overarching goal of a business process, as well as an attempt to organize \nthem into a formalized framework of the Open Digital Framework. Examples of using \nthe TM Forum BPF can be found in GB921B. \n4.2. Information Modelling methodology \nThe information framework provides a 'data' view of the enterprise.  The SID identifies \nreal-world objects of interest, models them as entities (or classes).  The framework \nthen identifies important class characteristics, or \"attributes\".   Definitions are provided \nfor both the class and the attributes.   In addition, relationships between these classes \nare identified and modeled as well. \n4.3.
