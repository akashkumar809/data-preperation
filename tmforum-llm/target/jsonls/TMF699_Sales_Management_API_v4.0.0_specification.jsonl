Page 6 of 40 \nIntroduction \n \nThe following document is the specification of the REST API for Sales Management. It includes the model definition \nas well as all available operations. \n \nThis API provides interfaces for Sales Lead, Sales Opportunity, Sales Quote and the other management capabilities \nto support the sales activities to build relationship with the prospect customer who could be a person or organization \nthat has an interest in the goods and/or services and possibly become the actual customers with one or more \nsubscriptions. \n \nThe first release of this API specifies only the SalesLead resource. \n \nThe Lead corresponds to the nominal result of an interaction involving a prospective customer towards one of offers \nor services. It is the first stage (S) of the SPANCO process. \n \nA prospect could have expressed a commercial interest or a commercial interest has been detected from his behavior \nanalysis. The Lead Management function enables to collect, evaluate and attribute the leads to the appropriate sales \nrepresentatives. The lead is an interest concerning an offer family or a product line, or expressed literally during an \ninteraction, possibly further to a marketing campaign, and it must be handled and specified to become an \nopportunity or an order. \n \nIn a nominal way, once the interest towards offers or services is confirmed and the prospective customer clearly \nidentified, then an Opportunity is created."}

Page 8 of 40 \nSupport of polymorphism and extension patterns \n \nSupport of polymorphic collections and types and schema-based extension is provided by means of a list of generic \nmeta-attributes that we describe below. Polymorphism in collections occurs when entities inherit from base entities, \nfor instance a CustomerInterest and B2BInterest, inherit properties from the abstract SalesLead entity. \nGeneric support of polymorphism and pattern extensions is described in the TMF API Guidelines v3.0 Part 2 \ndocument. \nThe @type attribute provides a way to represent the actual class type of an entity. For example, within a list of \nSalesLead instances some may be instances of CustomerInterest where other could be instances of B2BInterest. The \n@type gives this information. All resources and sub-resources of this API have a @type attributes that can be \nprovided when this is useful. \nThe @referredType can be used within reference entities (like for instance a SalesLeadRef object) to explicitly denote \nthe actual entity type of the referred class. Notice that in reference entities the @type, when used, denotes the class \ntype of the reference itself, such as CustomerInterestRef or B2BInterestRef, and not the class type of the referred \nobject. However, since reference classes are rarely sub-classed, @type is generally not useful in reference objects. \nThe @schemaLocation property can be used in resources to allow specifying user-defined properties of an Entity or \nto specify the expected characteristics of an entity. \nThe @baseType attribute gives a way to provide explicitly the base of class of a given resource that has been \nextended. \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2019.

Subsequent POST calls will be rejected by the service if it does not \nsupport multiple listeners. In this case DELETE /api/hub/{id} must be called before an endpoint can be created \nagain. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 409 if request is not successful. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for registering a listener. \n \n \nRequest \n \nPOST /api/hub \nAccept: application/json \n \n{\"callback\": \"http://in.listener.com\"} \n \n \nResponse \n \n201 \nContent-Type: application/json \nLocation: /api/hub/42 \n \n{\"id\":\"42\",\"callback\":\"http://in.listener.com\",\"query\":null} \n \n \n \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2019.

Page 38 of 40 \nUnregister listener \n  DELETE /hub/{id} \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 204 if the request was successful. \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 404 if the resource is not found. \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a request for un-registering a listener. \n \nRequest \n \nDELETE /api/hub/42 \nAccept: application/json \n \n \nResponse \n \n204 \n \nPublish Event to listener \n  POST /client/listener \nDescription \nClears the communication endpoint address that was set by creating the Hub. \nProvides to a registered listener the description of the event that was raised. The /client/listener url is the \ncallback url passed when registering the listener. \nBehavior \nReturns HTTP/1.1 status code 201 if the service is able to set the configuration.  \nUsage Samples \nHere's an example of a notification received by the listener. In this example \u201cEVENT TYPE\u201d should be replaced by \none of the notification types supported by this API (see Notification resources Models section) and EVENT BODY \nrefers to the data structure of the given notification type. \n\n\n\u00a9 TM Forum 2019.
